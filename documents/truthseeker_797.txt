@annettesnders @allareblessed @corvid317 Worst states in terms of deaths per capita are NY, NJ, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Mississippi. Texas is just below the national average. 

Deaths per capita seems a better measure of severity than cases per capita as testing rates vary widely between states.
