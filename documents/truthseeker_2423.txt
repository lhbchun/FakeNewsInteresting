@s_madore @ProcReg @JasonZacharyTN EXACTLY. I did all of that&amp;more.Fully vaccinated. Mask;went very few places. Heres what you @JasonZacharyTN dont get: Delta is HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS&amp;transmissible. This variant is NOT Covid-19. I get it, though. U dont believe in science though your kids wear mask every day.
