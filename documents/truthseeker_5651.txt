@DrJacobsRad @gmbutts @erinotoole @waliedesq So....If I won't give this new vaccine to my kids bc it is relatively untested for long term effects and uses technology that has mrna technology never used in a human being, I'm now an anti vaccer? Fuk that. I care about my kids. Covid 19 will not affect them so why chance it?
