@alexanderrogge @RepThomasMassie That's not true about flu vaccines. I STILL get the flu with having had the vaccine. My case is just supposed to be milder than if I had not gotten it. But I will not be getting any more flu shots now that I know they put aluminum in them. I don't need THAT in my brain.
