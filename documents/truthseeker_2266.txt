@SethMacFarlane Thank you! My MIL has a severe &amp; rare kind of blood cancer. She was vaccinated &amp; tested a while afterwards for antibodies. She had NONE. Vaccine did not work for her. People need to stop thinking selfishly. Get vaccinated or wear your effing mask if you refuse to believe science.
