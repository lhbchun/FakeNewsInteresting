@darrenrich63 @ProgressiveNCD1 @RepAndyBiggsAZ the virus can cause lots of problems like major respiratory issues or organ damage that could persist well beyond the initial infection. Even if the IFR ends up being one percent or below, that wouldnt mean that 99 percent of the Covid-19 coronavirus cases are totally harmless.
