@Chromedomenyc @GovKathyHochul Oh HELL NO!!! Im fully vaccinated and want my life back. I do not plan on wearing a mask for the rest of my life. I stopped wearing a mask as soon as I got vaccinated. If you believe in the vaccine then trust the science that youll be safe. Dont force your fear on everyone else
