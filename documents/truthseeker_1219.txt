@ji_meth @gwynethannchua The vaccine only protects the individual fr getting serious illness resulting fr covid infections, but it does not prevent spreading the virus if she's infected. So it doesn't matter if she's vaccinated or not. Violating quaratine protocol should have her penalized under the law.
