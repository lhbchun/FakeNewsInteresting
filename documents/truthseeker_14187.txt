@acemsdavis1 @globalhlthtwit @benking01 What stats did you use to work that out? The forged Govt ones? "Cases" are going up because testing is through the roof and the PCR test is too sensitive and not fit for purpose. Also, hospitals no busier now than this time last year. Blame Govt for hospital issue, not covid
