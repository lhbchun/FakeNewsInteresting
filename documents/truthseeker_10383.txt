@RandorCam @mikeinthevalley @adriandix @richardzussman The numbers that this Adrian Dix is using is data probably collected via CDC protocols. The CDC's protocols for death certificates and diagnosis inflate numbers so high that by definition, the data is inaccurate. And that includes reports of ICU beds being used DUE to Covid.
