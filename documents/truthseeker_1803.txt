@WatchYourRepsMN @nikgorelen0701 @RepMaryFranson Is Comirnaty widely available or not? Walz is saying that the Pfizer vaccine is fully approved by the FDA." If Comirnaty is not widely available, people are getting the EUA vaccine. You can say they are exactly the same, but one is FDA approved and one isn't.
