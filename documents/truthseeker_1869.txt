@CatFinola @SwipeWright All true. It's probably not a very popular position. I would be interested to hear from somebody with it. My favourite one is that it's not the pfizer vaccine that's approved in the US, it's comirnaty. It makes no sense to me. Why get one approved and supply something different?
