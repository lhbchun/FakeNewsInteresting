@fantacyfuccboi @why_you_s0_mad @dsleon45 Pfizer vaccine is fully FDA approved.  Moderna is still FDA approved under emergency use authorization.  Also, the vast majority of hospitalizations are unvaccinated. How many more need to die from the virus to convince people?  Is 800,000 in the US not enough?
