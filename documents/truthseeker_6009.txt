@ASAFourways @cheomitII @AfroArsenalista @AlastairMcA30 No, it's more than that. The virus needs hosts, vaccinated have lower viral loads, even infected. So lower transmission, trends downwards. So selection pressure is more transmissible variants in the unvaccinated pool. One new variant could have vaccine escape. AKA deep shit.
