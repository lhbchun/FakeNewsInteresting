@PLociraptor @HahaCal @BrianAn97922889 @chelseahandler If It is a NEW VIRUS...why does its antibodies show up in more positive tests than people who are actually sick? Only one way for antibodies to show up, and that is having already came in contact with it!! It has also been proven that a "common cold" can cause a positive test!!!
