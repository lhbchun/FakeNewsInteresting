@Robert_B @f_l_o_u_r_i_s_h I can't with a modicum of logic interpret the CDC guidelines as encouraging the false reporting of Covid related deaths.
In addition, the conspiracy theory that hospitals are using Covid as an excuse to inflate their numbers to get financial benefits/resources is profoundly weak.
