@CampusArtPrints @MalcolmNance You know President Trump received the vaccine? He was vaccinated in the very beginning. This is a classic lie of you liberal idiots. President Trump never discouraged taking vaccine. In fact he encouraged it. But he still understood it was personal decision. U know like abortion.
