@the_brooding @BraveheartKat @_johnbye @DailyExposeGB @AwakenedOf Congrats you moved the goal post. They're wrong because that 82% is very skewed. IF it were the actual rate of miscarriage 40% then yes they could claim the vaccine is dangerous but we don't have an accurate rate because the study isn't complete, and a conclusion can't be drawn.
