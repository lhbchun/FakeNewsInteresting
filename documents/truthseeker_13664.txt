@gregholman3 @cassienotcaffie @courierjournal Yes, just like the flu or common cold (also a coronavirus and can cause you to test positive on COVID test). I know several who have had it, recovered just fine. The fear mongering is a bigger agenda. Dont fall for it! Doctors and scientists are speaking out but being censored.
