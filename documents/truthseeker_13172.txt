@defnite_c @BuurmanNBuurman @sdh_1 i don't see a problem here. unvaccinated people had the choice to get vaccinated (unless they have some sort of hereditary diseases or any other reason and can't get vaccinated that is not "bill gates &amp; microchips") and are ruining the freedom for vaccinated people imho
