@LizzieCernik @PetiteBlondine I personally dont think the vaccine is a risk either, although I understand people feeling cautious about a brand new mRNA technology not used in human vaccines before, I think thats natural. Again, have no doubt its safe &amp; delighted for those vulnerable &amp; others who choose it
