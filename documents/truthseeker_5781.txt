@NRafter @EricJMartin @conorsen As I have told you before, yes it does. The only way to prevent an escape variant from developing is to ensure there is herd immunity so the virus dies out. Otherwise it will keep spreading in the unvaccinated community and eventually mutate enough to infect the vaccinated.
