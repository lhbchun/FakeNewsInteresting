@C4mi13 @ellenbergeytan @DjokerNole @amolrajan @BBC1 Look, I have natural immunity. Covid for me was a joke. Nobody knows the possible long term effects of the vaccine. Why risk it? Looks stupid to me at this point. That virus is not dangerous for me, never was. It is dangerous for others and they should take different decisions.
