@cmkudela @chrisiz4real @EpiEllie There is no place that has gotten clobbered after having 1/2 it's population vaccinated yet. The key is yet. If/when a variant develops in an unvaccinated person that can escape the vaccines, then things change. We are on the viruses timeline, even if we hate being there.
