@sinhakumara1 @DjokerNole The vaccine is still experimental, based on covid alpha variant.  People who had build up natural immunity after infection are equally or even better protected.  That is science too.  To enforce experimental vaccines on people is an abuse of human rights and the Neurenberg code.
