@Guido_Smeets @KimBoon94 @GeertenWaling 2. As I just said, the current COVID vaccine(s) are not the first mRNA vaccines. Human ex vivo trials began 20 years ago and in vivo trials (against rabies and many more the following years) started 8 years ago. Actually, big pharma invested over 10 years ago in this technology.
