@TrennyRay @AlisonKIRO7 @KIRO7Seattle @Mariners Well Trent, Im vaccinated and have recovered from the Rona. I have more antibodies in me right now than youll ever hope to have. 

And, since I believe in science, my preference is not to wear a mask outside. 

So, take your opinionated arse elsewhere.
