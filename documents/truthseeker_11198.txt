@MrGreenway2 @BuddyMyls @CassandraOfOvun @JesseKellyDC Get a vaccine that just killed your spouse for a virus with a 99.9% survival rate? How dense are you? The vaccine is not a sensible treatment for everyone. Im unvaxed and got Covid with mild symptoms. Now I have natural immunity without the myocarditis. Win-win.
