@Jeffmcfadden15 @Muscadaisy @AMeskell Tests look for the virus sars-cov-2. Getting a positive for the virus doesnt mean you have symptomatic infection. Asymptomatic infection is less likely to cause transmission.

And more confusingly Ive read positive virus detection doesnt mean you have covid-19 (like HIV/AIDS).
