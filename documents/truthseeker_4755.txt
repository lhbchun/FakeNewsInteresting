@DubbaEwwTeeEff @EyePatchGuy @burningtirez Simply put: there are limits on what non doctors have access to. If a news reporter asks for your vaccination status, that's not a HIPAA violation. If pharmacy staff accesses info they aren't supposed to, that's a violation. You're not obligated to give them private info.
