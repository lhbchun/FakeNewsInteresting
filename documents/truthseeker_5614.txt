@flatfootphil @IsabelOakeshott Oh dear, don't you realise by now that this covid jab is NOT the same as any other retroviral vaccine.
It is synthetic mRNA, never used in human vaccines before now.
NOT THE SAME.
This is where the concern is. Most people who don't trust this new technology are NOT antivaxxers.
