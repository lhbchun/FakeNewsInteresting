@keepwhistling @Angelo32279415 @AlexBerenson Those deaths are not higher than the average daily death rate. Only, we test them after death for COVID. 
1. We dont have autopsy to confirm cause of death, only that they tested positive for Covid.
2. Tests aren't accurate, test positive with common cold.

DONT LISTEN TO MEDIA
