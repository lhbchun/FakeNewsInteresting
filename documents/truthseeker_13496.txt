@handklaver @DavidBCollum Testing positive for a virus is not a case. Sars cov 2 is the virus covid19 is the disease that the virus &gt;might&lt; cause. covid 19 is a case not a positive test. Also apply the same criteria for deaths and cases to common cold viruses and you will get another pandemic by tomorrow.
