@theAliceRoberts @jestercredible No, your junk science is crazy voodoo scientism to suggest these added restrictions when teachers are barely at risk of getting at all ill with covid from the classroom, and almost no risk of a bad outcome. Kids, even less risk than teachers!

Debunk the junk, and derestrict now!
