@ToddMalcolm23 @GregAbbott_TX Lol  the best day he is referring to is Sunday numbers that still recorded 1,130 fresh cases. Texas has seen at least 1,000 cases/day every single day for weeks now. Big big trouble. And even on Sunday saw 1,500 cases, this too with some of the lowest per capita testing.
