@cprinatlanta @GovKemp Is the CDC still using the faulty PCR test (with high RT cycling) to falsely inflate numbers in order to spread more panic and fear? The PCR test they quietly admitted last month, could not differentiate b/n Flu or Covid??Delta variant is more transmissable &amp; LESS virulent BTW.
