@murdzboiBob @not__isabel No, he said that about mRNA vaccines, not about the Covid Vaccine in general. Also, again... you can look up MULTIPLE studies that show you the Covid Vaccine isn't altering your cells. Hell, gene therapy starts to alter your cells right away, not over 10 years like you suggest.
