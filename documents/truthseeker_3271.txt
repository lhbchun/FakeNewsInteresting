@Notfollowingthe @RichardFairbra9 @RayUngerer My wife and I have not been well since we had the two AZ vaccines. We seem to have a permanent cold with cough. I'm definitely not going to try a Pfizer booster on top. The Pfizer CEO was not allowed into Israel because he hadn't been vaccinated. I wonder what he knows?
