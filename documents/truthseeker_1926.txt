@davidacharrison @dickson_geo @MrMatth68584062 Im not looking for an argument either and am neither pro or anti but the Pfizer one on their own website is still in trials till 2023. Never before has an MRNA vaccine been used. Ever. The majority of the vaccines are authorised for emergency use. Not yet approved.
