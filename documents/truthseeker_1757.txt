@christymaginn @icf103 @faithlovefree33 You did not receive Comirnaty. It's unavailable in the US. I also received a Pfizer vaccine. It was not Comirnaty. The vaccine both you and I received is under EUA license. It was not an FDA approved vaccine. No one has received an FDA approved vaccine in the US.
