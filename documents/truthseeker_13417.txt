@22deans @DaveMFC1984 @LozzaFox Coronaviruses cause what we used to call the Common Cold. No one denies Coronaviruses exist. 

The issue the fact they inflated cases, hospitalisations &amp; deaths (ie Covid Death = for *any* reason following a positive test) to justify lockdowns, taxes &amp; a social credit system.
