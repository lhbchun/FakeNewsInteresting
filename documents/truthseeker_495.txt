@ProjectLincoln @realDonaldTrump Over 5,100 new cases in TX yesterday. 7-day moving avg here is at 4,038!!! Meanwhile, we rank 42nd to 43rd in testing per capita. Now we know why @GregAbbott_TX @GovAbbott hasn't worked to increase our rate of tests here. Greg has put DT before TX. #TexasCOVID #GregAbbott #Texas
