@MosheKeller @SeanTweet @Not_the_Bee Im just gonna leave it at this. The Covid vaccine does not prevent you from getting Covid or spreading it. Please do your research on how they work. 2nd: They do reduce the severity of the symptoms therefore giving you a less likely chance of needing to go to the hospital.
