@TabarnakDan @Eldin_Mrkulic @unstoppablebtc @danielkotzin I'm not going to debate semantics with you. With or without "most likely" is still the same claim with a conclusion based on logical fallacies. The pfizer vaccine has shown substantial evidence of efficacy and has been approved by the FDA so it is no longer an EUA vaccine.
