@phoenixfire2010 @GovRonDeSantis How is it part of long term solution when it doesnt stop omicron variant and likely wont stop other future variants? The vaccine is obsolete. Natural herd immunity is the long term solution. With declining severity, covid is soon just another seasonal coronavirus like the flu.
