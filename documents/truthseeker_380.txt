@swampsteve @languagewitch_ @dansolomon @chick_in_kiev Opening is ill advised when testing per capita is low and contact tracers are few and far between.

Texas is only doing 11 tests per 1000 ppl and have a 9% positive rate. A low test rate usually means capacity is a limiting factor.

Whats the testing plan &amp; capacity per 1k ppl?
