@RubenFromDeep @DavidJHarrisJr FIRST OFF, I'm a Biden voter, through and through. If I was on fire and Trump told me stop drop and roll, it would still be my first priority to defeat Donald Trump.

And second, the vaccine plan is identical to Trump's. Worse, I heard Biden lost 20 million vaccines recently.
