@MsDeadInside @twtrGuy @TinkerChip @AndML38 @xhejed Different sequence = Different virus

#SARSCoV2 virus causes #COVID19
It has a different sequence to the coronaviruses
that cause common cold

The PCR detects SARSCoV2 sequence specifically

Flu &amp; common cold coronaviruses
will not result in a PCR positive test for SARSCoV2
