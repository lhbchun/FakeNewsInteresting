@ApolloGarvan @ItsOasus Whether they got one or not is not a HIPAA violation. That info is required to gain entry to certain public systems. Providing the info IS still optional

a healthcare worker stating (veiled or not) the child's vaccination status that they administered is likely a HIPAA violation
