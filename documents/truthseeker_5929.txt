@Metalrulz81 @SeanSillyFilly @SaveFarrisLSU @tomselliott @ChrisCuomo @ASlavitt You claim to understand the risk and support vaccines, yet you advocate for a strategy that allows it to spread again in our unvaccinated population (to include children) with the hope that an escape variant doesnt develop. Im sorry, this is too big a problem for you.
