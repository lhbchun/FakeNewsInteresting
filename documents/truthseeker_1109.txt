@ducksinmypool @cmac72316162 @softuch25 One can get infected by vaxxed people, too. The vaccine merely gives the vaxxed a chance at having less severe cases. Being vaxxed does not prevent one form getting covid or spreading covid. One should do what they feel is right, of course one might risk the boss letting one go.
