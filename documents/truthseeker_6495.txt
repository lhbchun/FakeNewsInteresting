@aew4_life @quigonusa2 @RMConservative Covid viruses are a large family of viruses that have been around for a long time. Covid 19 is just a variant from the Covid virus family. It's not unusual for viruses to constantly change through mutation, oftentimes creating new variants, so these new variants were expected.
