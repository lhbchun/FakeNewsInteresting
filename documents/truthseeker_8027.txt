@CaptainLit_ @slevyDC My bad what are we arguing about? 

Indemnity for Pfizer? 

Or that their CEO chose to NOT get the vaccine 7 months before I could? 

Or about DMX dying from the vaccine, and not a cocaine-induced heart attack? 

Im probably on your side with corporate indemnity &amp; Pfizer profits
