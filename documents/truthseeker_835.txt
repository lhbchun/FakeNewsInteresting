@LynnetteMetts @theadvocatebr @NOLAnews By late Feb (Feb.25), #COVID19 was still a liberal hoax according to @realDonaldTrump. No way @LouisianaGov would cancel Mardi Gras when POTUS was saying #coronavirus would disappear by April w/ 15 cases tops. We still dont know the # of cases bc we arent testing enough.
