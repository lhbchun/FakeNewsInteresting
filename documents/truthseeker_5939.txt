@GroveLab @bealelab Isn't this unlikely as variant needs to be resistant to a large number of epitope sites in spike simultaneously? Also vaccines should prevent high viral loads in individuals reducing probability of escape evolution. What's not clear is role of variation generated in unvaccinated.
