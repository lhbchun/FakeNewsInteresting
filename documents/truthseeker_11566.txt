@ceegee12345 @adogslifeint_o @davemues @CheriDiNovo How many of those unvax'd people in the hospitals and ICUs already had COVID and recovered before the vaccine was available? My natural immunity has lasted well over a year from previous infection, completely blocking even the highly contagious omicron. Zero vax, zero boosters.
