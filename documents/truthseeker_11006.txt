@BigDan46580 @Diggsyograve @WishYaLuckk @TheN3gativeone Dude, you literally said Willie Mays died first. I think that would be news to Willie Mays. Link me to something reputable that says Hank Aaron died of a blood condition. Also, again you're saying COVID has such a low death rate, but the vaccine is killing people. Lmao
