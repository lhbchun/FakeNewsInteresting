@Garrexb @dwillinger @GovAndyBeshear Yes really! We were advised if you took this vaccine, it would prevent getting COVID. We were then told we needed another shot to be certain. Then we learn we need a booster to prevent getting it. Now all of the above may just lessen severity, but do not prevent spreading.
