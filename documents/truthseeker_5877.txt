@AdamBlayney @FreeSpeech_0 @Cedar50 @HackedOffHugh @chrischirp PHE on Sat say that now the Indian variant can escape vaccination.

Its not just the young unvaccinated getting it &amp; possibly getting long covid now.

Rather than 50% protection with 1st dose its down to 33% 

&amp; not 100% with 2nd but 60-88% with 2nd dose.
So all are at risk.
