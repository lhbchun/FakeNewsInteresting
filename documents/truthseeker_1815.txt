@VinnieAntoneli @Cormack77 @CaracticusPotts @SwipeWright The only FDA approved Pfizer vaccine is called Cominarty but that is not what it has been used in the US. The one used in the US is authorized for emergency which gives them immunity from legal liability; the FDA approved does not. They say they're the same...we'll never know...
