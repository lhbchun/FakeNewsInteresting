@mhantain @Axelrod49166728 @EwanMacKenna Because they want Zero Covid. They wont officially say that yet because with seasonality all the numbers are going to fall very soon. But when autumn comes &amp; they crank up the testing, the PCR pos cases will be back. Then they can force the government down the zero covid road
