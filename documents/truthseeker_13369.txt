@NoThatsNotOK @welshladycymru @drbarnesbangor @MaizyDaizyZzzz Also, we dont have a test for COVID. We have a test for SARS-COV2 which can cause COVID-19 but it can also cause nothing and it can also cause the common cold. A postitive PCR for Sars-COV-2 is not a positive for COVID-19, you should know this if you are an MD.
