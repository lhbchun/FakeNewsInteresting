@luvinlifew @CaliforniaJax @Greengigs2000 @BBCWorld The common cold does NOT cause a positive COVID-19 test. Youre confusing a diagnostic test (which determines if youre CURRENTLY infected) with an antibody test, which tests to see if you were EXPOSED IN THE PAST...a positive antibody test can be due to another coronavirus.
