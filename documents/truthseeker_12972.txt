@TomYates9816 @katiemcfcxo Genuinely not arsed about going to clubs and what not. Im arsed that everybodies human rights has gone out the window and there has been more suicide deaths in the last 2 months than coronavirus. The new generation of children will be so badly educated, use to online not books.
