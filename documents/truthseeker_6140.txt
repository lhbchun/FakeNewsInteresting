@StinaJoy @trader04 @drboycewatkins1 Vaccines don't CAUSE the variant. Variants can come from people who are vaccinated because of immune escape (i.e., an insufficient immune response to the vaccine leads to infection, which then leads to the same potential for variants as infection in an unvaccinated person).
