@BillMines51 @Susie_Q1971 @caroloffcbc @CNN Bill, most of us still unvaccinated havent given a shit about the restrictions and therefore done our time with Covid. For me and nearly everyone I know it was extremely mild. Now we have natural immunity. Why risk it with a vaccine that nobody can say without a doubt is safe.
