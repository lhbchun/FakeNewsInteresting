@melekalikihucki @dwg3903 @JoJoFromJerz Explain how vaccine works?  Does it actually destroy the virus in the person who took it? If not then what is to prevent a vaxed person from spreading the illness?  &amp; If both vaxed &amp; unvaxed people can spread it how do we know it was unvaxed person who is responsible for spread?
