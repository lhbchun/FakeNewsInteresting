@The_Moonrakers @RobMiller1968 I believe it was more aimed toward elderly in care homes. Even PHE and NHS stated a positive test wasn't required, confirmation from symptoms was enough to declare covid as cause of death. Symptoms I might add that share similarities to the common cold (as per nhs website)
