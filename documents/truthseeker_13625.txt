@annielieb2 @johnsoncody11 @brookehuston_ Just because you test positive for corona doesnt mean its covid-19. The test they give tests for all 19 forms of corona. Some of those other forms can cause stiff like the common cold and flu. What happened to that dude was bad though I dont disagree with that
