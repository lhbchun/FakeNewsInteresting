@Kishandreth @KerriMPR @MPRnews We can't necessarily control what happens in other states, the federal government is likely allocating resources to the places which have 50% positive rates like NY and NJ. What we can do is get MDH testing higher than 100 tests per day, private labs are doing the bulk of tests.
