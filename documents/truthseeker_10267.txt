@complex_maths @MichelleGHunder @clairlemon Interesting how there were no deaths from flu and pneumonia. Everything was called Covid to inflate the numbers. CDC have already said that 75% of all Covid deaths involved four our more co-morbidities and the average age of death was older than average life expectancy.
