@tifferrobinson @doctor_oxford @dnpocklington Agreed. Im concerned about the removal of any sensible precautions. Infection rates are already very high in the young and unvaccinated now and this will roll back into the other age groups. Delta has partial vaccine escape. High infection rates = an even worse variant.
