@RebootedSystem @MoonfireArt @80s_MEME_CENTER @Cernovich Well your argument should be people who had the viruses and can prove it shouldn't need the vaccine which i would agree.  But to those who haven't had covid they don't have natural immunity and are far safer getting the vaccine then catching it
