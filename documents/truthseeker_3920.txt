@EtherealBlu @ScottAdamsSays @julie_kelly2 You're correct in that aspect. I only got one jab and will not get the 2nd. I will burn my vax card publicly in protest. Anyone who pressures someone to get the vaccine is in violation of the Nuremberg code. Most likely everyone who took the vaccine will die a premature death.
