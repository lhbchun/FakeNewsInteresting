@Ivorbigyin11 @SkyNews Imo it makes more sense to lockdown until end of Jan/Feb, administer the vaccine to who qualifies during that period &amp; then open up in Feb/Mar when a vaccine is readily available for the wider public,yes,might b 2 more months LD, but Im pretty sure well have to LD in Jan anyways
