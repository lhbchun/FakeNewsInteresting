@CityOfLincoln @LNKhealth @MayorLeirion Trumps comment last July: Cases are going up because we are doing more testing. So I guess because Lancaster/Lincoln is doing substantially less testing and therefore the number of cases is lower it must mean fewer people are getting #COVID19. Completely illogical....
