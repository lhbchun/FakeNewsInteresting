@jeffmansell @robin__ @KSVesq Dentist is correct: employing a staff member (hygienist) doesnt allow employer (dentist) to disclose vaccination status of staff members, violating their HIPAA privacy rights.

Dentist could state what office vaccination policy is, or patient could ask hygienist (who could lie).
