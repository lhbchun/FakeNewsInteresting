@HerderGreg @GreenesLlama @laurenboebert So you're saying that the constitution says it's okay to break the Nuremberg code?  

The fact that you can't answer the question is my point. No covid vaccine has passed human trials so the human trials are the entire population. That's a direct violation of the Nuremberg code.
