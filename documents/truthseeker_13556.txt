@D_Crayzy @tannewton81 @ColinRowley1 @SeibtNaomi ... Some states are under reporting deaths, while others, like the recent case in Florida are reporting the cause of death as covid when the individual died in a car accident

What compounds this is the fact that you can gave *just* a common cold but test positive for covid
