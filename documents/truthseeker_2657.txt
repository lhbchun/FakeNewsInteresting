@dotsandloops21 @laplante_meghan @news4buffalo Yeah. I hear you.
I tend to think like you but the cases in wny are so low, despite allowing vaccinated people to go mask free if it was a threat at this point, wed be trending up. Not down I trust in the vaccine. &amp; I believe science shows kids are incredibly safe.
