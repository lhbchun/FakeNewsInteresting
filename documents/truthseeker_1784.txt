@scotgovhealth @scotgov @NHSScotland @P_H_S_Official You don't allow people to choose their vaccine like they do in other countries. I don't want Astra Zenica. I want Pfizer or Novovax if approved. Been turned away 5 times this year, but the nurse last time said I could get the Pfizer booster but not the 1st dose. Change the rules.
