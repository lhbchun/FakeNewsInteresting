@Mrcarmie @RoddickEmma @killeen_gerry After 2 years and what we know about covid please stop comparing to polio, it is not remotely similar. Yes reinfections Im aware, well the experimental vaccine itself only lasts a few months so Ill take my chances with natural immunity than submit to 4 injections a year.
