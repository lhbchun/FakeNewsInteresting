@Shark_Trader21 @Sandancer60 @JamesMelville @Coupdtat4 The evidence doesn't seem to support that. The reduction in transmission is not "great", it's at best moderate, and we know asymptomatic carriers can spread Covid-19. I think the evidence suggests that there shouldn't be large gatherings, even with total vaccination.
