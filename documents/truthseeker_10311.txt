@angie_eeee @Massadonious @otogomes @TheRickWilson That theres an inflation of Covid deaths reported?  Is this an argument of the statement of cdc guidelines and an interpretation of those?  Because Ive heard it before, but theres  no evidence of widespread falsification either to inflate or deflate numbers.
