@Liquiddiving @KevinKileyCA @Dwhthediver Not everything Big Pharma markets as a vaccine is a vaccine. These experimental shots were released in record time under EUA and they do not prevent contracting/spreading Cov. They help w/ symptoms for a time, but then require ongoing addl doses, longterm effects unknown.
