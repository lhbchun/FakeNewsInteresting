@2017_itstime @DirkMondragon @CBSNews No. The flu is worse, cupcake. I have a perfectly good immune system and the Healer of all! Masks cause more respiratory issues than Covid. Oh and the common cold is also a strain of the coronavirus. Also, if anyone has had a flu shot, they will test positive for Covid :)
