@JamesfWells @JuliaHB1 @fmwales I should add, just in case @MarkDrakeford doesnt know, once the group of vaccinated cause an immunity escape variant, there is no way to get it back in the box. The vaccinated have zero immunity to any SarsCovi virus for the rest of their lives. The unvaccinated retain immunity.
