@SarcasticNiffer @Rectitude20 @MapYourSuccess Why, starting in 1986, were there suddenly so many more (diseases) that were dangerous &amp; so many more vaccines that were necessary to protect the children? Was it that vaccine manufacturers were no longer liable if their vaccines injured you or was that just a coincidence?
