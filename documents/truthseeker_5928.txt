@notbronz @behindmyscreen @ValdezWinther @AhmedBaba_ this is "escape mutation" and well known.  it is yet another reason we need to vaccinate everyone as soon as possible to stop the virus in its tracks and reduce the risk of a vaccine-resistant variant.  you know what else creates mutants faster?  the mass of unvaccinated people.
