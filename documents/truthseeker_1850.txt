@JamesHerder @BleedingMarine Let me clarifyComirnaty, the approved vaccine is almost identical to the one available called the Pfizer vaccine, except that legally the FDA approved Comirnaty, thus you cannot sue for the Pfizer shot since it was not approved under the Rx name it has. That was done on purpose.
