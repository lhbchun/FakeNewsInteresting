@Michigan_Noah @RepTroyNehls @joerogan According to Oxford dictionary a vaccine PREVENTS diseases and the spread thereof, ie like with measles, smallpox, polio vaccines etc.

These highly experimental MRNa gene therapy  "shots", with proven waning efficacy do NOT qualify as a vaccine by the very definition!!
