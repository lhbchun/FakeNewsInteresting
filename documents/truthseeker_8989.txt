@Curious20244085 @forrestmaready Most Covid vaccines so far use different adjuvants (irritants) than aluminum. Aluminum is cheap and effective at creating immunity, though theres a collective amnesia on what it may do in the brain.

Whenever its available for kids, the #Novavax vaccine has no mRNA or Aluminum.
