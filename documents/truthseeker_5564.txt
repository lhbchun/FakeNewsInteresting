@cuttingejs @DFisman @BogochIsaac @TheBeaverton Firstly its not a vaccine its a booster. Its a new experimental technology never long term human trialed. No animal ever survived mRNA studies.

Emerg approval. No liability for manufacturers. In the past if 50 people died from a vaccine it would be shut down. U want more?
