@theJustinVachon @rupasubramanya @ezralevant So, Justin to inflate Covid numbers you either must fake deaths or move them from one cause to another. Moving them doesn't account for &gt; 1 million more deaths. So, I suppose you think the CDC made up those deaths. But, what about the fact that it is happening all over the world?
