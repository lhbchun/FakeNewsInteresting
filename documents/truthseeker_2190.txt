@misplacedsouthy @ChrisSchmittCle @Delta If youre scared of ppl not wearing a mask on a plane, maybe you should stay home. Im sick of ppl telling me to mask up while still telling me Im anti science because Im a conservative. Im a nurse. I believe in vaccines. Im vaccinated. If vaccines work, why are you scared?
