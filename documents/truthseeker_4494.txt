@kruano447 @rabbit_rascally @FullThrottleFem HIPAA covers vaccination status that's IN THEIR MEDICAL RECORD from disclosure by the doctor.

HIPAA doesn't apply outside of health care I think it's a popular misconception with the ADA.

This should show up on the death certificate which are usually public record.
