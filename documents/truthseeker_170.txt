@Lee904ldw @senrobportman Narcissistic vanity. Trump had it all under control. He wanted it to stay that way, at least the appearance of it. More testing meant more cases, making him look bad. The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. He was thinking about himself, not the economy. Foolish.
