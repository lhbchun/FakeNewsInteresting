@SwampWitchLeigh Better safe than sorry. Ignore the ignorant. We deserve to keep ourselves safe in the best way we believe. I'm fully vaccinated &amp; still wear a mask outside my home. I don't judge others I encounter who choose not to wear a mask. Science will speak truth &amp; reveal. Delta Variance!
