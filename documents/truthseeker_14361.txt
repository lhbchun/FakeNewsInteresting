@andysactionpix @CMOH_Alberta Common denominator- cases and hospitalizations and ICU will be going up because more people are taking the experimental jab. Lots of people are testing positve after the jab. Soon youll see kids in the hospital since 12 and up will start getting it. They may call it covid21!?!
