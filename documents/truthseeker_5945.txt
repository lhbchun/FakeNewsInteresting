@libsoftiktok @RyannMcEnany EVERYONE must get vaccinated, except individuals with a valid medical reason. Unvaccinated become potential virus variant creators, these selfish individuals allow the virus to mutate further until a new variant would be able to escape the protection that the vaccine provides.
