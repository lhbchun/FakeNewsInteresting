@histevedaly @ConceptualJames Also administering a vaccine during the height of the infection count (which is comprised of vaccinated and unvaccinated) creates the greatest risk of promoting an escape variant.   And it had a semi-escape variant in Delta and an escape variant in Omicron, both predate the vax.
