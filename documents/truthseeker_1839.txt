@LakeCountry @LauraChapin @johnnymsr987 @ShannonBream Neither did the small pox vaccine. You can still get it but you become asymptomatic. It took 150 years because maybe the technology was nothing compared to today. Pfizer is completely FDA approved. You can not prevet the contraction of a disease. So misinformed..so ignorant..
