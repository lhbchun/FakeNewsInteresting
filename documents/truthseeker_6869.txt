@TheRealDogeTok1 @maskymaskerson @lsharp159 @PoliticsForAlI I dont know what you mean by asympomatic transmission? Like, comparing asymptomatic transmission with with and without the vaccine? Generally tho, adults infected with covid-19 three weeks after receiving *just* one dose of the vaccine were ~45% less likely to pass the virus on
