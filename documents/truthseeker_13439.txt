@GrooveRedneck @CoolFoo65831623 @BBCWorld We have death statistics, although flawed, if you die of, lets say pneumonia, but test positive for Covid-19 your death is recorded as corona virus. There are 4 types of corona virus that cause the common cold. Covid-19, like all corona viruses, spreads fast.
