@blackmage1984 @Schnurpit @WolfepackMama96 @Travis_in_Flint Ever wonder why more individuals have died from this mRNA gene therapy injection than all of the combined vaccines in history. In the past, if less than a tenth of the individuals had died in prior vaccine studies, they'd be halted. Today, there's been thousands who have died.
