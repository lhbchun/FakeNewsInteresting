@AntonionKim2011 @ALEXANDERNY1 @FoxNews Lol, doing very well? Florida is leading the whole nation in cases per day while testing way less. Texas is very close behind. SD has the highest cases per capita and one of the highest deaths per capita. And you being black have nothing to do with you being uninformed.
