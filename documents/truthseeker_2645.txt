@wolfepoppycock @alexfromvenus @maddow Oooooo but see? I'm vaccinated, wear a mask to keep myself and other's safe, practice social distancing and believe in science. Doors everywhere are open to me. Can you say the same?  It's not about me, it's about keeping those safe who can't get vaccinated...#justsad
