@Alex52033756 @Mike_OntheLam @ThreeEyedRat @jordanbpeterson It was proven that the CDC was not differentiating between covid and the flu during testing so all the numbers are fudged. It was also proven that they named deaths as covid even if a person was only carrying the germ but does of other means. All to inflate the numbers.
