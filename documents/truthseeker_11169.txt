@Laughing_Murphy @nedorton @davendesi @slnpol Uuuh, natural immunity. That thing that let's people get the virus several times? That's let millions of people die of covid? (Not to mention all the other diseases)

As far as I'm concerned you don't have to take the vaccine. Just stay inside till the virus is gone; fine by me.
