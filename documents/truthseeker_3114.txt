@footballmad001 @ROSSJARRETT1 @thecoastguy Vaccine - more people take the less transmission - helps to bring transmission level low or eradicate.
mRNA gene therapy - drug to lesson symptoms (apparently). It does not reduce transmission - I give you Omicron, mostly likely born out of mass vaccination.
