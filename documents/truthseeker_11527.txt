@4NDYT4YL0R @EdnaKB2 @sympaticoshores @BBCWorld Anti vaxxer is such a lazy label. I'm definitely not an "anti vaxxer". My children have had every childhood vaccine. After catching Covid (early days before the vaccine) I made the informed decision not to be vaccinated as I believe I have natural immunity.
