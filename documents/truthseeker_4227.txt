@Maaksu @AmericanEthical ALSO this isnt even mandatory vaccination! If people are so weird about a vaccine they can just be hermits. Thats what Macron is saying, before the vaccine everyone had to stay home. Now it should only be the people who refuse to get the vaccine. Keep their germs to themselves.
