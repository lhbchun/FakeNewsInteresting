@SandyWright999 @sheannz1 @StarMoo64447315 @politvidchannel Thats more reason to not get vaccinated if you are the 5%. 

Also, someone needs to be able to donate Covid-19 convalescent plasma. Because when you get the vaccine, it illuminates all prior Covid antibodies you made. So you cant donate anymore (according to the Red Cross)
