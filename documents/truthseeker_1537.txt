@Northernbred1 @susannareid100 @xandvt @DoctorChrisVT It's finding balance, I'm a massive believer in vaccination but as a white man it's easy to say everyone should be vaccinated as I've not had family die in somewhere between pseudoscience racism and downright murder.
Hopefully we can convince more to take the vaccine.
Stay well.
