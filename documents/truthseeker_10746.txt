@CNN @CNNOpinion Hank Aaron &amp; Willie Mays were among the few superstars in sports a Black kid could idolize back in the day.

Mr Aaron was in good health..I saw him on TV a few days ago taking the covid-19 vaccine. I wonder if it had anything to do with his untimely death?

Although he was old...
