@lisapatriot45 @JonathanMCarl @svenhoit @Keepgettingblo2 @pyrxtc @Jim_Jordan I am not sure why you are so willfully ignorant. The Pfizer vaccine that people are receiving in the United States, if they are over the age of 16, is fully FDA approved. You can crinkle your tinfoil hat all you want, it will continue to be fully FDA approved.
