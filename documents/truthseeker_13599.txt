@RaviSubbie @westbornegirl @PaulEmbery The doc's can put covid as a cause of death without testing. Plus the tests check for antibodies released; these antibodies are the same for many others &amp; the common cold. If you had the common cold; you'd test positive for Covid even though it was not! The numbers are fake.
