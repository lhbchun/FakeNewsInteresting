@BluDogAnchorite @eraqbjorn @TheJniac @AlexandrePersJa @BernieSanders The jury is still out on that. It was never MMR specifically that was blamed, either. Something never researched (or never reported) by vaccine makers was the effect of  adjuvants used in their vaccines, specifically Aluminum, a neurotoxin they believed didnt enter the brain.
