@HindlesKitchen @Breaking911 Its a numbers game the libs play on their mindless followers.
They opened the drive thrus up again with PCR test. We already know from the CDC that test can't tell the difference between flu or covid.
Now the inflate the numbers. Libs get scared. Ask for more government.
