@TheNerdonaut @PsychicDiandra @LakotaMan1 @Maritimer61 You are flat out lying, and I suspect you know that. No amount of fully vaccinated in the population will stop the spread. Because this vaccine doesnt prevent transmission  Its not like the MMR vaccine for measles. Try doing research, and stop spreading disinformation.
