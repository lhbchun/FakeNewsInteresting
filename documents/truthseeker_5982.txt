@Herfstrood @ScottAdamsSays Vaccine-resistant variants need to infect the vaccinated in order to mutate to escape vaccines. A vaccine-resistant variant would not mutate to evade vaccines in an unvaccinated individual. Herd immunity comes from exposure or a vaccine. T-cell memory from exposure is long-term.
