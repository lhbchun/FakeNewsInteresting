@TheDailyRaven @deadlevelbest @Paulm68 @BBRoyal15 @danorlovsky7 @bykevinclark It's HIPAA

To clarify:

If you choose to disclose medical information about yourself (vaccination status, for example), that is NOT a HIPAA violation.
If a doctor discloses that same medical information about you WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT, THAT is a HIPAA violation.
