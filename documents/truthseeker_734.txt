@HaConde @EliStrawmanning @katkein @ComfortablySmug Texas has 4.7k hospitalizations, and 1.4k people in ICU. That is the worst in the country. Texas is also usually #1 in new deaths daily. Texas is also one of the WORST fucking states in the U.S. for testing, per capita. Last I checked they were literally bottom ten.
