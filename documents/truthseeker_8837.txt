@doritmi @Mommabear1231 @gorskon Hey DORITOS -maybe provide PROOF that polysorbate 80 -a KNOWN blood brain barrier DISRUPTOR &amp; vaccine ingredient-isn't allowing NEUROTOXINS like aluminum, foreign animal &amp; human DNA, multiple antigens &amp; other vaccine ingredients to cross the blood brain barrier. YOU CAN'T DO IT!
