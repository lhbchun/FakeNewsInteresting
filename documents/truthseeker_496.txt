@AlexBeck08 @mikesonn We're approaching 10k tests/day and Texas is at approximately 21k tests/day while their pop. is 6x MN; we're also leading in per capita testing at 2,600/100k vs 2,200/100k - in terms of re-opening, seems we are well positioned to keep up and if you're sick, get tested, #StayHome
