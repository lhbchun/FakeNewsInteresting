@MoonInEasternNC @RealHousewifeMi @lyndaPT72 @mimimcg07 There is a law called HIPAA. A private individual does not need to disclose his medical information (including vaccination status) to anybody but their own doctor. If a company enforces this "order", they are violating HIPAA and are subject to lawsuits. Which I hope happen.
