@readthinkwalk @antoguerrera @zerocovidzoe Cases mean fuck all. Theyre going up because hypochondriacs are testing like mad and its free days off work for people in cushy jobs. Deaths are so low, youll probably be disappointed. Hardly anyone dies from covid, more will die from the insane restrictions &amp; lasting effects.
