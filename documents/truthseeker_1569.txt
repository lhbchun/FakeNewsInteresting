@MermaidsPurseJ @MichaelRosenYes "Herd Immunity" is achieved by VACCINATION and takes 70% to 90% vaccination rates (depending on the virus)

Labeling "just go ahead and let everyone catch it and 1% of them die" as "herd immunity" is just a euphemism for mass murder by policy because we think it's cheaper
