@London_poverty @krys10iam @ronnymuller4 @LauraChapin @ShannonBream The vaccine that is available from Pfizer is not the FDA approved vaccine. It is still the EUA Biotec. I challenge you to go and ask your local pharmacy or doctor where you can get the FDA approved shot and see what they tell you. Ill wait!
