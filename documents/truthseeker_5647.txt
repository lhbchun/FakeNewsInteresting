@klebenov3 @slobis76 @Mel4Him777 @NidalAllis @chopkinsaz Taking a vaccine "or not" has nothing to do with my worldview or fear. I've had vaccinations in the past. If you wish to be a part of a global trial using experimental mRNA technology, by all means go ahead. My basic human right is to either accept or decline being a participant.
