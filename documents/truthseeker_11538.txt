@iamtheWaterman @DavidOB49226197 @BernieSpofforth Yep, I have no problem with natural immunity. However, FAR fewer people have actually been infected with covid than is needed for any herd immunity. Plus, even with omicron, the health risks from deliberately catching covid are still higher than the vaccine.
