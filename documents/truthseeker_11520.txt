@glencard98 @WorldCOVID19 @FoxNews The graph shows clearly that the risk for the un-vaxxed (solid) is much higher.
When comparing natural vs vaccine immunity, they are very similar, BUT with vaccines your risk of getting covid or long covid is much lower.

Natural immunity, even with Omicron, is a bad idea.
