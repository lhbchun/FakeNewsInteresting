@JulesWi51615518 @AlistairHaimes Because we are testing over 800,000 a day including huge amounts of asymptomatic cases. My town has rapid testing places for people with no symptoms &amp; some people are going there twice daily for testing (before &amp; after work). They are obviously going to pick up extra cases
