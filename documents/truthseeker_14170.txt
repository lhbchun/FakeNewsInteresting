@iamcefoley @ActualEPAFacts @IvankaTrump They are that stupid! Just like Trump saying the only reason the covid-19 cases keep going up is because of more testing so if they stop the testing the numbers won't rise, lol. So stupid to not realize that just because a person isn't tested doesn't mean they can't have it.
