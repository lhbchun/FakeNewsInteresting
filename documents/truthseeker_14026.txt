@Jonathan232221 @ReconnectedE @Wildcats_Dad Say that to the people who are affected because they trust their president and how he didn't tell them they HAVE to wear masks. Personal right to not wear a mask affects other people and themselves. Trump literally stopped testing because cases are going up. Wtf is that logic...
