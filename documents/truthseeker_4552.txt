@Naterjake4115 @aloeemporium @christo36114147 @TeToLaVeTo @Bills99LFC10 @JoeBuscaglia So... you're saying the NFL has violated HIPAA law for years when they give medical status and injury reports?
Or are you saying HIPAA only applies to the condition being sick and/or vaccination status?
I think you need to relook the actual "facts" about HIPAA.
