@djvanic @aarononpc @BudzBeatz @3mmawa @rave444444 @SmokiTx @Eptic this argument is so tone deaf bc I know multiple ppl who have died from coronavirus and several more who have ongoing health issues bc of it. jobs are replaceable, people dying of covid are not and I promise you theres way more ppl dying of covid than committing suicide
