@regohurtado @bdonedone @ShannonSharpe Again, per capita is all that matters. I see your point about the graph. But Texas COVID rate is still 20% higher than CA. Case rate not a reliable indicator of COVID severity anyway. Relies on amount of testing done. Hospitalization, ICU admission &amp; death more reliable indicator
