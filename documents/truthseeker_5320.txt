@Matt87118222 @ScottyAmerica1 @freedomUSATRUMP Ok, glad Pelosi can't block police testifying. However, acting Police Chief Pittman has declined to testify. What is that really about?
Hope they include pictures of those people in the Capitol just milling about taking selfies. Majority did not commit violence.
