@UTexLonghorns @MNDarkfire @leongongre @PatrickRuffini @rabois Didn't clear anything up lol, I don't believe Texas is reporting accurate data at all or testing enough people for political reasons of the constituency. Just defending the Bear Republic, which has also tested 2x people than Texas, 1.5x more per capita.
