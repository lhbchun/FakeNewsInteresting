@MaryPetzinger @JoshuaHol I dont think you do understand this vaccine. Getting vaxxed doesnt prevent people from spreading it. Yet, you want those spreaders to have full access to society, but a different group of spreaders cannot. If youre not fearful of unvaxxed, why try to keep the unvaxxed away?
