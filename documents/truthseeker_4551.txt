@soul4ever @komonews BTW FYI @soul4ever, it is NOT illegal to ask about one's vaccination status. HIPAA privacy rules prohibit the release of protected health information  by others without your consent &amp; have nothing to do whether you can or should answer questions about your vaccination status.
