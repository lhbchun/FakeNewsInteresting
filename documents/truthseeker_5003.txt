@ljmpool @JanetWood101 @VikiLovesFACS The 82% miscarriage rate for vaccination before 20 weeks is based on incomplete observation of this pregnancies and too high. The factcheck at the other hand doesn't state the true rate. The rate is therefore unknown and we don't know if the vaccine is safe for this group.
