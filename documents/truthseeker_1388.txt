@Sonk65100874 @ThomsonDenis @estabrooksphoto @ryangerritsen I dont have to have a smallpox vaccine to be allowed to work &amp; feed my family. &amp; anyway the smallpox vaccine *does* prevent you from getting and spreading it. Also, you could opt out of any vaccines, including kids at school, if your doctor was ok with it. Not with this one.
