@lisa_proust @alanfryermedia @ezralevant No, we will not all test positive for Covid19. Yes there are many types of coronavirus, and some cause the common cold. This one is a new strain of the virus which is more serious and can cause pneumonia and ARDS. Same goes for SARS in 2002. Not all coronavirus are the same.
