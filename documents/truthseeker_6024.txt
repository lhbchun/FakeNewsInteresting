@hughosmond @RufusSG @sailorrooscout @CMO_England Is that controversial?

You previously claimed that the vaccine promotes escape variants like delta, so it appears you have walked back from that.

(And vaccines are still highly effective against the delta variant - which is why most infections are in the unvaccinated).
