@riffraff0007 @JackPosobiec Because a business asking you to self disclose your vaccination status (as an example) is not regulated under HIPAA because that are asking YOU not a covered entity (Your doctor or Health Plan). If vaccination disclosure wasn't what you were referencing ...I'm sure it's the same.
