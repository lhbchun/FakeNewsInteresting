@jojo_bubbaHowie @Adamr0602 @mattgaetz Those listed are actual vaccines although If I had to do it all over again I would say hell no. Regardless this is not a vaccine. It doesn't prevent one from catching or spreading cv19. So whats the point? People can chose for themselves and can't be coerced. See Nuremberg code
