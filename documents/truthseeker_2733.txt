@ShanMoff @Gators5and12Nc @ElectionWiz mRNA is an exp gene therapy and not a vaccine. A vaccine contains *finite* amount of dead or attenuated *isolated* virus material to trigger the immune system to develop T-cell immunity. While mRNA generates toxic spike proteins in infinite amounts in your body. Enjoy.
