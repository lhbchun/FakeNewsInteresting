@DubhLinn76 @Daviddoylearts @Dublinheadshot Whilst testing isn't perfect (no test is), the 'cases are going up because of testing' argument is nonsense. Hospitalisation rates are rising. Lots of the 'life threatening' illnesses are v common comorbidites, i.e. hypertension, COPD. These people shouldn't be dismissed glibly.
