@SMck6883 @dmj0361 @Debbie76543 @nytimes It is the same. FDA site states that investigational drugs are the same as experimental. I stand corrected though on the Pfizer vaccine. You are correct that it is approved for 16 and old. The others are not currently approved. You leftist love to call people names don't you.
