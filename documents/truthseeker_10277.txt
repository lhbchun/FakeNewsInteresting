@LynnHolliday8 @BobbyStrake @StevenDelDuca @fordnation Less than 1% of both vaxxed and unvaxxed end up in hospital when contracting Covid. Also, CDC and Ontario has admitted they don't differentiate between those who are there for Covid and those who are there for something else but tested Covid +. That will inflate the numbers.
