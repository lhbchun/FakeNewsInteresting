@RJ_Macnaughton @CryanGrim @JohnSmi48253239 @Elizabe58050122 @WalkerBragman @alexkotch IFR (infection fatality rate) vs. CFR (Case Fatality Rate) is the key because the CDC has used CFRs to inflate their numbers - thats the rate in which ALL deaths are recorded - even deaths that had nothing to do w Covid, but had Covid in their system at the time of their death
