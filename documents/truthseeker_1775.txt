@combat_medic @jerzeygirl99 @joekent16jan19 The Pfizer vaccine is FDA approved, not experimental. 

2 fetal cell lines were used in testing only for Pfizer, NOT manufacturing. 

Hepatitis A, Rubella and chickenpox vaccines are all required by the military and all use fetal cells. Why didnt they protest those vaccines?
