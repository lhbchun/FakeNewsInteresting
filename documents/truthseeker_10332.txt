@tara_bert @wingshock @IngrahamAngle The CDC isnt tracking flu cases because theyre used to inflate Covid numbers so states can continue to pass mandates that infringe on our freedom. The Covid test has a high false positive rate &amp; the Covid survival rate is around 99%. Those at risk could die from the flu too.
