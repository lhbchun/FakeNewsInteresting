@BridgetTrygar @detroitdawg58 @TomPelissero But were we not told when this vaccine came out that it would prevent us spreading covid?  It was the selling point to get us to take it.  Now because it didn't do what they told us it would, even after 3 boosters in less than a year, they changed the reason to take it.
