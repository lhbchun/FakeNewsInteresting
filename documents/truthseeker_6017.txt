@Dr_D_Robertson @andrew_croxford @BristOliver They should test vaccine status by variant status interaction. 
I think Andrews point is if unvaccinated people only are in hospital we should not be too concerned yet about escape. I.e. vaccines can still be the way out. 
For public health this news is still major concern imo.
