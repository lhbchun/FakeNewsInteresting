@HoldingOn8 @GMuelMuel @JordanSchachtel Your professed ignorance is not an argument.  But to be clear, Comirnaty was FDA approved but not available in the U.S. The predecessor to Comirnaty (i.e., Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine) was authorized for emergency use. That is the only available vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech.
