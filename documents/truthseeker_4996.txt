@emgwoo @jwpk12 @ggreenwald You're pregnant and took the vaccine? You're lucky as hell. 1st and 2nd trimester who took the "vaccine" showed an 82% miscarriage rate. You really took a risk taking an untested medicine and exposing your baby to that. Do you drink wine and smoke too? You must hate your baby.
