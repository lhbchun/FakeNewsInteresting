@Johnnywas25 @Elephantstopper @PrisonPlanet We know vaccine efficacy wanes and some studies have shown its possible theres negative efficacy after multiple boosters.  Immunity from prior infection may wane but its not known definitively for how long.  I got Covid 2 months after 2 shots, natural antibodies still high.
