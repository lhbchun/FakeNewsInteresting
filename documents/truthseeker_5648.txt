@joeBevacqua2 @real_GGoswami @ronInBendigo mRNA technology is unlike anything we've seen before. It's not a drug or a vaccine in the sense we know it. 
The tech literally in it's infancy. In their own words, "rewriting the code of life"

 Pushing that technology onto the human population untested, en masse? Seriously WTF?
