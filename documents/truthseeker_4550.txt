@pairodoxx @Dangilbert09 @theMMQB @SInow First of all its HIPAA not HIPPA. They're 2 different things and neither one of them protects private businesses or organizations from asking about vaccination status. And so many jobs require background checks/medical records. You clearly have no clue how America works.
