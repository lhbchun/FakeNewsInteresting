@HarveyWall15 @Thenizfactor @Buzzard_99 @JordanSchachtel Pfizer does have a version of their vaccine that has been fully approved by the FDA called Comirnaty. With full approval, Comirnaty does not enjoy the legal protections that the EUA vax does. They can be sued. So Pfizer covers their ass by not distributing it in the US. 2/2
