@lhviera @dsteketee @markmobility @Moms4Liberty If you are vaccinated, why do you need protection from someone else wearing a mask? Particularly a low-risk child. Is it that you dont actually believe in science? Im a scientist, Im vaccinated, and I wont vaccinate my kids. No masks. Not living in fear.
