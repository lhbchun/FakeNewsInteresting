@TheLooseThread @DineshDSouza same thing the Dems did in Puerto Rico, inflate the death numbers. SOP for Dems.

Cause of death encouraged to be Covid if there's a whiff of it within the patient. Even though they actually die of pneumonia or heart attack or whatever.

Check out CDC policies. Scarf woman also.
