@CalmPolite @valoakley25 A warp speed vaccine, no long term safety studies, 1st time ever mRNA "technology" has been used in a human vaccine, not FDA approved, no evidence it stops transmission, and made by some of the most corrupt corporations in the world who care way more about $ than you. Good luck.
