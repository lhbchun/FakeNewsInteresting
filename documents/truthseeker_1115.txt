@JeffreyHallett @JedediahBila Please read many of my prior tweets. I AM VACCINATED w/ booster and highly recommend it. Vax does prevent serious illness, ICU &amp; death. It does not do much to prevent catching and/or spreading- especially Omicron variant. IMHO, vaccine mandate to prevent spread questionable.
