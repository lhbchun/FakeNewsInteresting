@2fuzy @PJO363636 @realTuckFrumper Im trying to show you we believe in the same science. I believe COVID is real. For myself, Ive had covid and survived. Did not need hospitalization. I wear a mask in public. I test weekly. I am contributing to variants LESS than vaccinated who dont wear masks or test weekly!
