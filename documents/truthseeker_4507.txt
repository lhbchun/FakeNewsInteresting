@jeffmansell @robin__ @KSVesq As a retired MD/JD (ie I was a covered entity who managed &amp; paid staff in my practice), I know more about HIPAA restrictions (depending on State, all employers have a duty to collect vaccination status of their employees, but cannot disclose their status w/out their permission)
