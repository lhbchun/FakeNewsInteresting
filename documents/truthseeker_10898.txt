@tonyagunn7 @mtaibbi @RobertKennedyJr Hank Aaron's death was not "suspicious" or part of any "wave" of elderly deaths after vaccination. I know a dozen or so elderly friends and family, some with compromised immune systems and other vulnerabilities, who've taken the same vaccine - 2 doses. 0 deaths.
