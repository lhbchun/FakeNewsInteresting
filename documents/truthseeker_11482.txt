@LoriAnnLothian @zeeke55 @CandiceBergenMP As has been true since the Covid-19 1.0, natural immunity is not nearly as effective as vaccination.  So, I mean, it does SOMETHING, but a) you're risking illness, death, and long covid and b) you're getting Great Value brand immunity.

The vaccine is fast, free, and safe.
