@kiwi_skeptical @SloganThoughts @In_Increments @chasevida @kristinhallNZ Regular vaccines that actually work, yes i agree. The vaccine you are talking about is about as useful as having a pet rock - both of them do jack sheit. The covid vaccines are only effective for the first 30 days and are still not better than natural immunity. Utter BS.
