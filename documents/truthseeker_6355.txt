@theRealJFriedz @Sens3Common @thoght21 @HapPendley @ChuckCallesto So what youre saying is catching covid from vaccinated is a different strain - A variant.

If caught from a non-vaxxed you get the same strain as the carrier?

So it the vaccinatedwho are constantly creating variants which are different from COVID-19.
