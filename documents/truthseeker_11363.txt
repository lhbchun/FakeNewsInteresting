@SJB1828 @rupasubramanya @JustinTrudeau I was at the protest multiple days. There were several nurses who spent 2 years taking care of COVID patients, got infected, recovered, gained natural immunity which is SUPERIOR to vaccine immunity and yet got fired for not taking the shots. You are okay with that?
