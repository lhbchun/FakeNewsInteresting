@lowder3000 @KhumoR2 @nanoza23 @mrejojo @NationalOrphans I see myself as a non-vaxxer than anti-vaxxer. I'm not anti-vaxx but I feel like there's many unanswered and important questions. One of them being that the Pfizer CEO himself hasn't vaccinated and his replies when asked left me bemused to say the least.
