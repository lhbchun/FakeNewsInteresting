@VanceHall9 @spensshayspitch @BradHud30414334 @ClayTravis You have fear over facts.  In my area of 500k pop count, 8.2% contracted and .13% deaths. CDC can only confirm 6% of all reported deaths as being directly attributed to COVID.  False reports by hospitals to get govt reimburse inflate the numbers.  You keep eating from the spoon.
