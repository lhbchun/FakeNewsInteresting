@dbechek1 @KatieM12121 @NellyTells OK, but you must apply that to 600,000 "COVID" deaths given the shoddy practices intended to inflate numbers.

Made obvious by CDC changing to reasonable PCR cycles, reports only of serious cases/deaths in breakthrough cases--which are then picked through for accuracy.
