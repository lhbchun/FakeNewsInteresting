@SteveMillerOC @PWrenusa @CleatTanner @angrybklynmom There's another one, those who say severe Covid-19 is based on age &amp; health. It's your medical choice to get the vaccine. Natural immunity works. The vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting Covid-19 or spreading it, you're not selfish or killing Grandma if you decide against it.
