@BorisJohnson @10DowningStreet I'm sorry but your policies are doing more damage to mental health than any coronavirus ever will. The virus is age and vulnerability specific. Why can't you understand and work around that? Suicide rate up (massively), cancer diagnosis etc. missed. Stop pontificating. Get real.
