@LindyMa66651571 @GOP Democrats never obstructed CDC guidelines on COVID. They encouraged social distancing, wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding crowds, and, when they became available, getting vaccinated.
Trump and Republicans stifled CDC guidelines, politicized the pandemic, and lied about vaxx.
