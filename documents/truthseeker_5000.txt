@i47606699 @Fedupgeogteach @RealJoelSmalley @wealdengirl @hartgroup_org @jengleruk @NickHudsonCT The truth is this:
127 pregnant women received peri-conception vaccine, before or very early in pregnancy.
104 of them had a miscarriage, the great majority we are told being in the first 13 weeks, the embryonic stage.
104/127
= 82% miscarriage rate

Would you vaccinate?
