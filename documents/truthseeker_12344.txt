@Snowbirdsix1000 @RepAdamSchiff @hazydav Gets paid more money if its labeled as Covid. So if doctors arent testing and theyre just labeling everything that has similar symptoms as Covid and if someone dies in a car crash and they test positive for Covid they are labeled as a Covid death even Birx and Fauci admit it
