@only__hughman @JMARTI100 @nnwajei @JennaEllisEsq No, actually the CDC said only a fraction of that number- 6%- died OF COVID. The remainder died from other conditions, and died WITH COVID.  It's important to remember, hospitals have a huge incentive to inflate the numbers, because they get $$$ for every death recorded as COVID.
