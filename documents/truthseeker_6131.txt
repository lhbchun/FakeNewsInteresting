@MMOrpgPrincess @leftyvegan @mjelse @LuisAFigueroa75 You are assuming that the vaccinated are impervious to the virus and any potential variant, which is false. Allowing a large unvaccinated population to intermingle with the vaccinated population is basically the best-case scenario for encouraging vaccine escape.
