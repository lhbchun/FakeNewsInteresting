@CawthornforNC @nancella11 Voting is a Constitutional right. Eating in a restaurant is a luxury. Because anti-vaxxers lie and spread COVID which kills people we have to require something to indicate they have been vaccinated. It's about safety. If a person presents herself to vote, what is the ID for?
