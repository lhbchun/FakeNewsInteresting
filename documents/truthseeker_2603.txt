@CATOtheCENSOR_ @Martina What a ridiculous argument. Science isn't about beliefs. Science is real whether you believe in it or not. Covid is real. Covid can kill. Vaccinations increase survival rates. Masks work to slow down transmission. These are facts. Get over yourselves, get vaccinated, wear a mask.
