@LukeJos12661169 @donwinslow primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is via respiratory particles, it is transmissible from presymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, &amp; asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires 2 things: limiting contact of infected individuals &amp; other measures (masks).
