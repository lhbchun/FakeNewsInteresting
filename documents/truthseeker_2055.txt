@Surviving_2021 @CDCgov They are finally starting to release treatments for covid. Pfizer just got approved for a new pill that, if taken within a few days of symptoms starting it limits sickness. The best prevention of not getting really sick is the vaccine. Make sure you got two doses and boosted.
