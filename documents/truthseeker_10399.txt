@ScottCharles_ @DrEricDing @YourGrowFriend @donwinslow We gotta get out stories straight here. Which is it. Last week everybody wrongly interpreted the cdc report and started stating that covid causes only 6% of deaths. Meanwhile you're here saying they inflate their numbers to cash in. Which is it, are numbers low or exaggerated?
