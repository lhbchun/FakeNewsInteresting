@faires_jacob @bricksmashngton @Pminn76 Trump was for himself, he isn't for Americans. Pelosi is a politician who serves the interests of the Democrat party and I agree she used the virus for political gain but there's no way she brought it here. She never encouraged people to ignore the virus or not get vaccinated.
