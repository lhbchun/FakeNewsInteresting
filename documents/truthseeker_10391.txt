@goldencell @kayleighmcenany @realDonaldTrump No, those numbers are totally wrong and the CDC actually did revise it to only 6% of that total that died of covid. Also all the fraud with the reporting of the cases to purposely inflate the numbers. The forced testing to create artificial surges. Do u lack common sense? Fake.
