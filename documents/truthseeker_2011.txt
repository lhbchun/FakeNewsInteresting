@LisaLisaG1969 @MythinformedMKE The vaccine that is being administered is not FDA approved. The vaccine that is FDA approved is called Comirnaty. It is not available. The one they are using in biotech/pfizer and it is under EUA which means it is still experimental. If you cant keep up, then be quiet.
