@hneilm @bradbury2010 @SueSueCurious @DrLeanaWen Yes I remember all those breakthrough polio, TB  and smallpox cases after the vaccine . Call it what it is, its a therapeutic to help reduce severity of symptoms for the person who took it but does not prevent all from getting it or spreading it. Its not a vaccine.
