@OriginalGinja1 @pyramuscrypto we haven't "cured" most viruses (particularly of the Corona-variety)

but, like, the influenza virus used to kill tens of millions annually (1918-1919) until we learned how to treat severe cases (fluids, cooling them off, vitamin C/D)

i suspect it will be the same with this
