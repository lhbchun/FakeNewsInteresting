@Zekapest2017 @mikeandersonsr @CDCgov @CNN No, I think it's an attempt to inflate numbers. I'm aware that Coronavirus is REAL and it can be DEADLY. It's not a hoax at all. However, why would the CDC say that it's fine to list someone's death as a result of COVID-19 if they HAVE symptoms but it's not confirmed via a test?
