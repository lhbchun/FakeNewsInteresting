@LadyBreland @chopse36 @Inevitable_ET Yeah, I did the delayed schedule until my daughter had back 2 back reactions. stopped before MMR, so she just has Tourettes. the problem with delayed schedule is that the aluminum deposits in the brain and accumulates. If child has MTHFR mutation - no vaccine is safe. Ever.
