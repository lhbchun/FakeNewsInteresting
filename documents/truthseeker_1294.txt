@Uileag @lanechanged I'm not anti-vax. I'm just against taking a vaccine that does not prevent you from catching, spreading, or dying from the virus it's supposed to protect you from.

Especially when the odds of having health issues from the vaccine are greater than the odds of dying from the virus.
