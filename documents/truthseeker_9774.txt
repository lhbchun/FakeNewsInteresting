@WeSt_1969_ @tommyvaughan @RandPaul Rand Paul has not accused Fauci of funding covid-19 creation. 

In fact, Paul has explicitly said that he is NOT accusing Fauci of that.

Have you not watched their exchanges?  Paul hints at that, Fauci gets pissed and says thats BS, then Paul says thats not what he meant.
