@AngieMTKD @mrjamesob @LBC More kids of died from suicide during lockdown than Covid19. The global average age of a victim of this coronavirus is 82, thats higher than the average life expectancy of a human!!! Think about that and stop spreading fear. 

My children need and want to go back to school.
