@Gabriel16203 @tomselliott Were you tested in 2015? 

COVID-19 is far from the deadliest disease, but its one of the most contagious - second only to Measles. Thats why it can kill millions even with a relatively low infection-fatality rate, especially with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission.
