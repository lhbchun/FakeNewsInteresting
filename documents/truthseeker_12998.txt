@CollinsforGA @realDonaldTrump Havent heard you comment or express condolences for the 200,000 who have died from Coronavirus. Do you care about those lives? What about the more than 30 million unemployed because of the failed leadership of Donald Trump? Anything about the people who are considering suicide?
