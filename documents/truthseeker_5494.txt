@HumanistRocker @GodlessLiz Havent seen or heard of these diseases. Before COVID-19 I was in New Guinea. Very poor corrupt government! There was an outbreak of polio on one of the islands! People forget how many people died from these disease pre vaccine! Stop listening to fools! Listen to real experts!
