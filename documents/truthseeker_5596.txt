@rugga13 @82Socrates @PeterHarkessNZ That's actually true and widely acknowledged. Dr Malone who was a key inventor of mRNA tech calls the vaccine a prototype, nascent technology, and not for mass injection. My best mate who has a PhD in Biomedicine and has worked extensively with mRNA agrees. Not for human use yet.
