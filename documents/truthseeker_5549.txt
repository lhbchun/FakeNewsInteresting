@Gritandresolve @allen_drewe @M6Squidlo @ElGuapoBear I not against vaccines.  Im not for rushed mRNA.  This is the largest human trial in history with a vaccine technology that has never been approved for clinical use.  And Pfizer is currently pushing the FDA to have phase 3 trials shortened.  I dont trust it &amp; Im not taking it.
