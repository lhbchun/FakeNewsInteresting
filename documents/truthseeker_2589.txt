@ickystijl @altadena @TheAdrianMaddox @kell11167 @JoyAnnReid I understand what you're saying. I guess what I was trying to stress is this. If a person passes on wearing mask or being vaccinated, because they do believe the science or not letting the government tell them what to do, then... I've lost the empathy gene it seems. My bad.
