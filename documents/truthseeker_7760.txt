@wolfmonkey10 @ElijahSchaffer Thats awesome!! The crazy thing is vaccine manufacturers havent been liable for vaccines since the vaccine injury act in 1986. Thats why when parents who have had vaccine injured children since 1986 have had to go to a vaccine court where they are just quietly paid off.
