@JaunchB @Demosthenes54 @DylanLeClair_ I can imagine ppl believing proven liars, called #Trumpism &amp; #TrumpCult 

There's no prove infected #asymptomatic ppl don't transmit #Covid_19 

Logical to believe if someone is infected that they're also contagious at certain times. Chance of transmission could be low, not zero
