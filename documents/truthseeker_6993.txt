@imchrischang @pattysellguelph @CTVKitchener It said so on the CDC website and countless other legit studies? Evidence shows that COVID-19 vaccines reduce asymptomatic infection and transmission. But youve done your own research (watched YouTube videos on the toilet) Not medical journals and peer reviewed studies.
