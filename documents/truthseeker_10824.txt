@PinkoScare @CinematicZodiac I understand your frustration &amp; I don't think schools should reopen but of course getting ppl to take the vaccine is her goal. There is a huge anti-vax rumor going around Atlanta rn b/c of Hank Aaron's death &amp; thats just one area of the country. Like the risk is very real.
