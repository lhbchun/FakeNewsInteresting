@Dawn_Ritchie @realDonaldTrump The cases are going to be higher where they actually have the capacity to test more. Just because a country doesnt have the capacity to identify cases does not mean those cases dont exist.

Any country could be low in the case count if they dont do a lot of testing. Wake up.
