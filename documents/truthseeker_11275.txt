@lisakwildman @whstancil @mehdirhasan If you haven't noticed herd immunity has not been talked about for a while. Herd immunity is typical achieved with a combination of natural immunity and vaccines that provide immunity. The covid vaccine does not provide lasting immunity so we will probably never get there.
