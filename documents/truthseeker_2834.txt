@SteveC29782796 @mallen1_nhs Who the fuck is taking gene therapy as a vaccine against covid? Is this going on in back street surgeries or something because the mRNA from the approved vaccines does not enter the cell nucleus or interact with the DNA at all, so it does not constitute gene therapy whatsoever.
