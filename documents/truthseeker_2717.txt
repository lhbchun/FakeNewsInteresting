@JTSEO9 @JackPosobiec @GreekFire23 Vaccine vs. Vaxxine:

Vaccine: Contains live or attenuated strains from which immunity is boosted. Highly tested over decades.

Vaxxine: A mutable mRNA gene therapy designed to permanently modify your DNA forcing it to emulate what they think the virus might look like. Untested.
