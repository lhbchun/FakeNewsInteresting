@Elishebaxoxo @premillenial @OctoberFerguson Agree with everything except want to add that when the newest variant mutated it achieved immune escape. UK is heading for another surge. Ppl not getting vaccinated will mean those of us who are will effectively be unvaccinated bc they give it more chances to mutate even more.
