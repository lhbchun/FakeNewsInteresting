@RennaEchelon @LeoMoonbb @and_kell Common sense is enough to know injecting mercury and/or aluminum into blood of a newborn baby is not healthy. But there are studies already linking these to brain injury. Also more kids are autistic than ever while vaccine schedules increased and vaccine makers can't be sued.
