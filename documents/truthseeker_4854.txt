@McVulvasteen @laceltris @rich_137 @politicalmath It is self disclosure. "businesses" asking you for your vaccination status, they're not asking a Covered Entity. If no covered entity is involved, then HIPAA can't be violated. HHS OCR, the people who wrote the law, and enforce it have said this is not a violation.
