@HarrisonZeiders @RealCandaceO Stay home if youd like, the rest of us will continue to live our lives. Viruses spread, people get sick. Sometimes people die. Thats life. The cases are going up because more testing but the death rate is going down. This is America, the stay at home orders are a bunch of bull!
