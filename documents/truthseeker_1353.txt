@PatienceTryer @BigFish3000 I didnt lie. Vaccines are supposed to prevent you from spreading the disease. When vaccinated your body produces antibodies so that when you are exposed to the disease you have milder symptoms with a low viral load. This vaccine does NOT prevent you from spreading the virus.
