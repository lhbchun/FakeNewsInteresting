@PumpknSpiceSoul @TaylorRMarshall Wrong. That is folly the CDC has reported to inflate the numbers. The actual number of people who died from COVID is 6% of that number.  

The other 94% died from other issues, and happened to test positive for COVID.

Study the data from the CDC. The truth will set you free.
