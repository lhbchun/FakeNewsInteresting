@josh_afc @HuwHarries @theousherwood Average annual flu deaths is 17k. The most weve had is 55k actual deaths unlike died with Covid19 &amp; Thats with a vaccine and it still didnt make the news. So our figure of 45k can literally be halved. More kids have committed suicide than died of coronavirus since lockdown.
