@JAGLeMans @90sgoldenera @ownbrand @UKCovid19Stats Not at all. There is no cover up. Fewer people are being tested - because schools and other workplace testing programmes are shut for the summer so we are not catching aymptomatics. Cases havent stabilised. They are going down by 2.2% with 9.2% fewer tests. So going up (?)
