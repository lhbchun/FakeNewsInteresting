@MarmsFury @werelemming @NathanJRobinson No. Because the vaccine doesnt prevent the washed (??) from getting and spreading it. It may keep us from getting sick, or make our symptoms more bearable. Im concerned about mutations, but were not releasing the vaccines to the world. So mutations are gonna keep happening.
