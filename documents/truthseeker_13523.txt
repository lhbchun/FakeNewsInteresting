@Tania38233615 @KatieFrenchOES @SharinStone @kayleighmcenany @seanhannity You do understand that the Covid test doesnt even test for Covid, yes? It tests for 198 different Rhinoviruss that can cause it. Some of these also cause the common cold! The CDC tells you this when it says if you test positive, you may have Covid!
