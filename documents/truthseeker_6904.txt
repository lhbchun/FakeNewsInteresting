@MJSullivan12 @catturd2 With time, you get more data. With more data, you get more accuracy. After a year and a half, I doubt we're going to suddenly reverse the scientific consensus on asymptomatic transmission of covid 19.

Of course some details may be wrong but little details. Not a huge about face.
