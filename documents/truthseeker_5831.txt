@DrKMcKenzie @BettyRatched @EricTopol That's not true. The vaccine or prior infection with any covid variant will give you 90%+ immunity to Delta as it doesn't have any immune escape abilities. What we're seeing is exactly what we'd expect from a highly vaccinated population - that almost all deaths are unvaccinated.
