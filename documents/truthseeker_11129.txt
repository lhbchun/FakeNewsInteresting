@GalacticaZ @matthewswaite A covid infection doesn't mean immunity by itself, but it does give you a boost of immunity, same as vaccines do.

Anyone who had covid should not just assume they have antibodies. Test regularly and if they fall, get a vaccine. But also don't shame people with natural immunity
