@mjone1000 @anna_banana4075 @easytravel2022 @USBornNRaised @mozartspig @Ella4Dogs Im not sure what argument youre trying to put forth here FDA approval isnt required for me to confidently say that a vaccine is safe and has been tested vigorously. Moreover, Pfizer *is* approved, so that ones definitely safe by your own argumentation.
