@DWUhlfelderLaw @WarnockWarrior Should we have trials for Pelosi/McConnell &amp; they testify why they as leaders of Capitol Police failed to provide proper security thus negating their responsibility which basically made it a preventable incident so if Trump should be held accountable they should also.
