@lrwsweeney @l_stone Over 99% of ppl who test positive have symptoms indistinguishable from the common cold. Most are fully asymptomatic. 

In Canada Covid deaths under 60 are 10's of times lower than seasonal flu/pneumonia, and that's counting everyone who tests +, regardless of the cause of death.
