@Loriann_Q @Marghareti72 @mdmcdonald19 @stoolpresidente You clearly didnt think this through! Please educate yourself first. The vaccine only help prevent hospitalization and help with symptoms and does not stop you from spreading it. My mom got vaccinated and got Covid. I know many others. Its everyones individual choice!
