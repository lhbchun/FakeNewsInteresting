@talkRADIO @iancollinsuk @rialina_ The Indian variant had vaccine escape. The vaccinated selected this mutation to be a variant. It was only dangerous to the vaccinated.

Then it lost its vaccine escape. This is because it would have entered an environment of unvaccinated. 

The unvaccinated saved the vaccinated.
