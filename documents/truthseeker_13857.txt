@taahkarry @Munashe_mb @S_Harudzibwi July 4, 2020  COVID-19 killed nearly 130,000 Americans, but Trump, speaking at the White House, maintained that 99 percent of coronavirus cases were totally harmless.

Trump for you, harmless when thousands are dying...Cutting WHO funding was not a solution though...
