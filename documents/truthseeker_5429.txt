@BigBrotherWatch @JuliaHB1 @GMB How can you ban people from public places like parks and other open spaces? If the public place is inside a building the owner could ban anyone who has not been vaccinated from entering. That is their right. Eg saftey of staff. Same with airlines. No vaccination no flying.
