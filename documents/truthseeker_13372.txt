@kriserickson204 @Nerdrotics @BrandonStraka @j_t_starwars Show me where all 250K are guaranteed Covid deaths when we're all aware the common cold &amp; influenza can cause a positive test result. Not to mention it's already been admitted those counts include those who may not have died from actual Covid but from other underlying conditions.
