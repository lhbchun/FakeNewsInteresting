@RealCandaceO @GovNedLamont @realDonaldTrump The NIH &amp; the CDC tell doctors and hospitals to write covid for cause of death if they think the patient may have had it since they havent had sufficient valid tests to go around initially. Not very scientific and will inflate the numbers. Also theyll get Govt funding.
