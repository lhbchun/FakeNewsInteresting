@Jessedegenerate @EssentialPerso2 @TaraLaRosa Did you know that Pharma has zero liability for vaccine injuries to children per a 1986 statute?  Or that the vaccine industry is a $24 billion market?  Do you know how many safety studies have been performed on injecting pregnant woman and unborn fetuses with vaccines?  Zero.
