@butts_4_jesus @CKL75279672 @TheBlondePI @Mavumavu91 Even if this were true (which I cannot find evidence of re: delta variant), it is a temporary situation.
Mass vaccination with non-sterilising vaccines on a background of high infection will result in immune escape variants. This puts both the vaccinated and unvaccinated at risk.
