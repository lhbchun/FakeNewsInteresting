@CynthiaFabian7 @Wyn1745 the covid 19 deaths have been greatly exaggerated! even the CDC  had to admit it, as of today they revised their covid death total from 67000, to the actual number of 37000! we have all been lied to about this disease! they used flu and pneumonia deaths to inflate the numbers!
