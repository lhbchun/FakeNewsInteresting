@Markwebster17 @ddsheltie4 @FogCityMidge @hwholcomb @realDonaldTrump Mark, just to be clear, ANY death is tragic! The COVID DEATH Charts are inflated, why? Presumed Cases are being included in these numbers. I lead you to CDC article of same. Reimbursement is another reason to inflate #s. Hosp/States are going broke!
