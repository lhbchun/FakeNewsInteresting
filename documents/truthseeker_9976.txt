@T_S_P_O_O_K_Y @jrpsaki Her sleight of hand needs some work. The issue is not necessarily whether Fauci funded the creation of COVID-19 (even though he probably did). The issue is that Fauci lied to Congress about NIH funding #GainOfFunction research on bat coronaviruses in China. They did. Same lab.
