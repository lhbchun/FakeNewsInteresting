@GlobalSentinel3 @BNODesk @EndGameWW3 Well 9 months and you still dont understand the data. Positive test rate is important because it tells you how comprehensive our testing is. 5% or below means we are probably catching all the cases. Sadly the US positive rate is going up as well as total cases.  Not good.
