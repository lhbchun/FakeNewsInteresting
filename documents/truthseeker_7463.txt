@GregNh1234 @sarahbeth345 @Cernovich The 1986 Act did away with vax manufacturer liability and created the vaccine injury compensation program. Only child/prenatal vaccines are covered. COVID vaccines MUST be routinely given to children, there is no stopping it. Otherwise the COVID vax doesn't get into the program.
