@Brttwill1 @Wontevertweet27 @IanMulvany Right above the section you clipped, it says: The FDA allows people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine to donate dedicated COVID-19 convalescent plasma within six months of their infection of the virus. They cant do routine donations, but they can donate convalescent plasma.
