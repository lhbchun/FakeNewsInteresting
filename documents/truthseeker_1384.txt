@eugeneboxcovcop @ErrolWebber The vaccine has been working. It increases your protection against covid, it doesn't make you immune or prevent you from getting covid entirely. Plus, now that Omnicron is spreading, the old vaccines might not be as effective, meaning it makes more sense that cases are rising.
