@dadalac @Cjfrommn @LarenceMcKordy @SouhanStrib CDC: "a growing body of evidence suggests that COVID-19 vaccines also reduce asymptomatic infection and transmission".  What do you eyes tell you there? 

You citing vaccinated ppl testing positive shows you can't grasp the difference between "reduce" and "eliminate".
