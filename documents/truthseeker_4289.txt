@GPCarlinJr @DinnoRen @davpply @zerohedge Yes, my initial statement is to Macron's suggestion of "mandatory vaccination", I hope it didn't get out of picture as we are very far from having a suitable vaccine for what he have in mind.
I do think having vaccines are good, but we should bear in mind that it was rushed out.
