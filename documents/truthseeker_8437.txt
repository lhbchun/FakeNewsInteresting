@terryannokane @bader_diedrich @TuckerCarlson Yes, all very good points. 
On a side note, the movie I Am Legend.. seriously with that cancer treatment or whatever it was. Obviously I am aware that it's total nonsense, yet anytime I get a vaccine now that stupid movie pops in my head. Full disclosure- I have zombie fear lol
