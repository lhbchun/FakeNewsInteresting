@Hexpatriot @apoorva_nyc @Asher_Wolf You do know, I presume, that 2.8m people die every year in the USA.  Far more from lifestyle diseases caused by poor nutrition than Coronavirus.  What do you think should be done about that?
And did you know that in Europe suicide are higher than the Coronavirus death rate???
