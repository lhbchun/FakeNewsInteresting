@NicodemusVI @19dxh @ImSpeaking13 Incorrect, there are break through cases, the Delta variant is  more able to sometimes infect the vaccinated, but the vaccines have all been proven to vastly reduce infection &amp; transmission, the longer the unvaccinated keep it circulating the more likley an escape mutant arises
