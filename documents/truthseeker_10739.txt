@BigDan46580 @Diggsyograve @WishYaLuckk @TheN3gativeone Bud, Willie Mays is alive. Hank Aaron? Didnt die from the vaccine, but natural causes. Even if you think 4k people have died from vax (it isnt that many, but cool story), you cant say the death rate of Covid is low but youre scared of a vax that is 50x safer than the virus
