@Destiny3650 @babysgramma With a positive ANTIBODY TEST, you'll be counted as a Covid CASE, and if you die by any cause after that test, you'll certainly be counted as a Covid DEATH. And you might have NEVER had Covid in your body, since recovery from the common cold produces the same antibodies as Covid!
