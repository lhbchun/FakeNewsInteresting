@JackPolakoff @RichardGrenell MSM MORON!!!!  Go check the CDC total deaths from EVERYTHING last year(2020)!!  On average with previous years DUMBASS!! If there where 440,000 deaths from Covid ALONE would not that number be 440,000 more than the average??  They just shifted columns to INFLATE the NUMBERS!!
