@25thcenturygirl @worldmade @sugarplumrose10 @jodotcom @CDCgov Well first the CDC should not inflate numbers of covid deaths I mean theres f**** videos of them literally saying anyone who tested positive within 28 days of death were checked as a covid death. Its just ridiculous. How many lies you gonna believe ??
