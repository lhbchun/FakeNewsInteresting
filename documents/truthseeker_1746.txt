@Acoustics_AN @DemijanOmeragic @EMA_News The EMA haven't approved Valneva yet, and aside from how unsurprisingly a company making a product will say it's good, the point is that AZ is a pretty effective vaccine so it's not a sign of Valneva being terrible if it's about as efficacious. What about the Pfizer trial?
