@MGB_andetc @farhana43048740 @twomad @hasanthehun Is it why the J&amp;J vaccine is now being called more dangerous? Or why Pfizer can sell ivermectin lite under a new name? Perhaps the immunity from legal consequence? What about not providing any of the FDA approved vaccines in the USA? Why are you ignoring their lobbying?
