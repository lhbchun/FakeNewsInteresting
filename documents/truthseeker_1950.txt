@CarolyneMas @ChuckCallesto Thats why the treatment isnt approved, its an EUA.  Probably why we have Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and not Comirnaty (which is different, but the same!!).  Also why Moderna and J&amp;J are still unapproved.  Bureaucratic BS to protect the Government &amp; Drug manufacturers.
