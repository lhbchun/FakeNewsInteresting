@disnenchanted @devisridhar Stop with the muzzling of healthy people. Asymptomatic  transmission of covid-19 is very rare. If you have symptoms stay home - if you are well, go about your life smiling at,  connecting with people - cos that is good for your immune system. Fear weakens the immune system.
