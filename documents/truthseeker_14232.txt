@michaelanglo90 @fact_covid @Join_ZOE 100% agree because numbers are low now and testing massively ramped up, its obvious cases are going to be found along with upticks, once summer is here I guess we will see decreases again but at the min I think itll be the obvious case of upticks and mini decreases
