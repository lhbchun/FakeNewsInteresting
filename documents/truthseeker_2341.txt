@zombiehotflash @FrancisGames999 @miffythegamer Cant believe after 20 months of taking careful precautions, let our guard down for 4 hours in a room full of negative tested, vaccinated people and boom.  Covid shows no mercy.  Its not rocket science - wear a mask, social distance, basic hygiene, test regularly.
