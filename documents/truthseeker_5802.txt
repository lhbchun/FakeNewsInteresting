@tomwilkinson84 @dthroat @UKCovid19Stats The vaccine programme has been excellent ..but, the vaccine isn't an immunisation and this variant (delta) has some vaccine escape so we need to be cautious. It is spreading in the school setting where there is a high level of unvaccinated. 
Deaths and hospitalisation always lag.
