@ShapiroPissbaby @jacktorrance182 @FoxNews Yes but that's still not a reason to force children and healthy people with natural immunity to take the same measures as elderly and vulnerable people. It's an emergency use vaccine. A child or prior covid infected person is not at an emergency risk of dying. Follow the science.
