@DavidGelit @WiseGuy0000 @lone_rides Up until January the left were saying that the vaccines were Trump death potions and would never take them.
At least Trump fast tracked the vaccines, got vaccinated himself and encouraged others to vaccinate. He (&amp; conservatives) are against mandates, thats it.
