@ottawabikeguy @Miens101 @ctvottawa why would i get an experimental vaccine when i have natural immunity from covid...

my immunity lasts. yours doesnt work at all  .

youve been lied to.

i got covid from a triple vaxxed person.

he was sick as fuck for over a week.

i was barely sick for one day...

weird eh?
