@JonathanLovesUs @boy_brook It's not about the kids dying, it's about the infection finding new hosts to continue its scourge amongst us, creating variants and spreading to those who are less immune.  With about 25% of new cases being the kids (i.e. those not vaccinated) we are allowing COVID-19 to evolve.
