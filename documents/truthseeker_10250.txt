@MatthewKovacik @explicitswrld @KevinTavris @atouchofsnark @realDonaldTrump U can't point to one person that may or may not have been misidentified as a covid death as some larger conspiracy to inflate numbers.  For everyone of these there are many more that died of covid that were never identified.  The 220k is an accurate number based on cdc data
