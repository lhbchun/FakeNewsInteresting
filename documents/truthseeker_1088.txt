@PaulBayliss9 @PNGEtrades @chuglibtears @nick_the_geek78 Lying is not debate. Spreading misinformation is not debate. Someone who chooses not to have the vaccine is not an antivaxer. Someone who spends hours of their life trying to prevent someone else making an informed decision based on fact, is an antivaxer. And you are naive!
