@nzane_believer @RealStarsky_ @lorisstuff123 @Quicktake @EmmaKinery My dude- once again, a vaccine mandate is not a hipaa violation. Employers and private businesses have the legal right to ask vaccination status, as well as require certain vaccines. You're more than welcome to refuse and be fired, but your rights aren't being violated.
