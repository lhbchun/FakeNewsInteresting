@justher89334999 @CraigRe20720035 @FillingLess @libsoftiktok There is not an FDA approved vaccine that is used. Comirnaty and Pfizer are not interchangeable. They are legal distinct, and manufactured at different locations. The Pfizer-BioNTech is the only vaccine available, and it is still under EUA. It is experimental. Youre a lab rat.
