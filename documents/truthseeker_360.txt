@JDVance1 @neeratanden Sugar Land resident here.  I can confirm we did not have large protests here. Same for the Woodlands.  

Texas Bars did reopen Friday of Memorial day weekend end. 

Testing has been very low here, with the 2nd most populous state never ranking above 42nd in per capita testing.
