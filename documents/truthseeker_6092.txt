@Flora42467984 @JoJoInNewYork @ASlavitt Variants only arise due to mistakes in replication.  Replication only occurs when a virus infects it's host.  More infected hosts = more opportunities for mistakes.  The unvaccinated are variant factories.  More variants = more opportunities for a variant to 'escape' the vaccine.
