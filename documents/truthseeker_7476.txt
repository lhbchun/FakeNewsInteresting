@HegKong @nursecaro13 @RachelleManios Did you know the vaccine manufacturers are already liability free? In 1986 Congress granted them indemnity for injuries and death caused by their vaccines. And state legislatures have been mandating vaccines for children for years, despite the outcry from parents of the injured.
