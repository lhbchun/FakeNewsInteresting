@Krisand74 @VanessaBeeley Vaccine manufactures have indemnity agreements so they can't be held accountable for any deaths as a result of vaccine. But it's bad optics if they killed Hank Aaron making vaccine rollout harder. So until there's a cause of death stated most people will assume it's the vaccine.
