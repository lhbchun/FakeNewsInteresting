@concernedcsi @AmeshAA @JohnsHopkinsSPH The MN case was community acquired. Regardless, my point was as it appears now, B.1.1.529 has a strong potential for escape. Will unvaccinated patients suffer worse disease? Almost assuredly yes. However it is too soon to say how virulent this variant will be for the vaccinated.
