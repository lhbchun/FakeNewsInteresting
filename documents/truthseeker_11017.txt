@Bubbanbubbles @RashfordTen @disclosetv I have no idea who Hank Aaron is, but I Googled him &amp; the articles I read said he was a baseball player, who's death was falsely linked to the COVID vaccine.  
But name calling is pretty low so you can shove your fat fingers where you regularly do &amp; fuck off.
