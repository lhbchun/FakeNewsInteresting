@hello_general @DukDolan_YT @321danielw @911spatcher @KEEMSTAR Like the fact that natural immunity is 99.6% effective against covid? And that some people actually develop myo/pericarditis from the vaccine? That data? And when has forcing medical procedures onto people ever worked before? If vaccines were effective, wouldn't people want them?
