@RMCarpiano @scottlay So many conspiracy theories that the Federal Vaccine Court has paid out over $30 million to injured children  who btw are not permitted to sue Pharma directly because of the 1986 Childhood Vaccine Injury Act that Pharma bought. Those must be some pretty convincing conspiracies.
