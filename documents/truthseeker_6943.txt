@hannagility @sleethestak @NiclasNp @ScottAdamsSays Wrong. We've been taught during this entire pandemic that you an "asymptomatic carrier". This means you don't have to be infected to be a carrier. Covid-19 is not like HIV/AIDS in which transmission &amp; infection are inseparably linked. That's why we were all wearing masks.
