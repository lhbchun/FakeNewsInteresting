@RyanPekarek1 @MysteryObsidian @AP So if YOU are vaccinated.. why do you care whether others are or not? You believe in the science right? And can still wear a mask if you please? Why not allow others to set their own risk-tolerance for a disease with a 99% survival rate and if they die its on them?
