@Cre8dave @Lauragtas I am not anti vax at all. My children have had all childhood vaccinations. The polio vaccine prevented getting polio, the covid vaccine does not prevent getting covid or spreading it to others. It has also caused over one million people to become ill, die, have heart attacks etc!
