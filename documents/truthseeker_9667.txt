@WeatherMyCarl @laurenboebert Trump received the vaccine in PRIVATE before leaving office, BUT HAD NEVER ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO GET IT.

President Biden and several other politicians, including former Vice President Mike Pence, were publicly vaccinated to help promote the safety and effectiveness of the shot.
