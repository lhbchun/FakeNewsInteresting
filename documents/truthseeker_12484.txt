@WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump Dr. Cleavon, MD: 

Trump: You know, our doctors get more money if someone dies from COVID

Truth: I took a 20% pay cut due to less patients. Lost 3 colleagues &amp; 27 y.o. cousin. Cried countless times delivering news of deaths to families. I'm doing more for the U.S. than you!
