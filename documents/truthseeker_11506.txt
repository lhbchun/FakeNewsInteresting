@glencard98 @WorldCOVID19 @FoxNews Yes, natural immunity is as good (even very slightly better) as that given by the vaccines, BUT it also wanes in 3 to 6 m. 

My point is that getting Omicron IS NOT an alternative to getting the vaccine because of the risks associated with getting covid when you are unvaxxed.
