@seabelothegreat @SizweLo Covid-19 "vaccines" are not vaccine by WHO and FDA standard definition. They at most gene therapy based on mRNA technology. You are being injected a genetic code for your body to produce a foreign spike protein in order to induce an immune response to the very toxin it produced.
