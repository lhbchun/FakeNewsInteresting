@arealbondgirl5 @AlexBerenson @pfizer Per the CDC, only 6% of those deaths were actually from Covid. The rest died of other causes but had Covid. I know 3 people who died and it was listed as a Covid death to inflate the numbers. 2 were over 85 and both had heart attacks and 1 from complications of a stroke he was 72
