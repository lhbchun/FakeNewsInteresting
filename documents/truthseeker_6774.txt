@ScroogeMcCuckkk @mririshred @cnnbrk 2nd one- didn't examine actual transmission of COVID-19 illness nor whether the masks "shorten the travel distance of droplets during coughing.Whether face masks decrease transmission from asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 or those who are not coughing needs further study
