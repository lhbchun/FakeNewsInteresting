@bglons1 @Ivanabreakfree @WardFish5tony That's because the majority of people are now vaxxed.
The  vaccine at 2+booster will not prevent you catching,spreading Covid.BUT, you will not be as seriously affected by Covid as the unvaxxed.
You won't block hosp beds as often,or for as long as the unvaxxed.
Get vaxxed.
