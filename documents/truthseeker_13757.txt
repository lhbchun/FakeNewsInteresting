@chroniclistmakr @Siggmak @ljpas2 You are evil if you force or suggest kids mask up. Kids have nearly zero risk from COVID. They do have psychological damage from the fear you project. They miss out on facial expressions. They breath in bad air. There is just no science or logical reasoning for kids to mask. NONE
