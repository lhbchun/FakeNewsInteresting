@janetleesimons5 @duckmansasylum The CDC has admitted that of that 600,000 only 6% of that number were people who actually died from COVID.  Is it horrible that people died? Absolutely.  But the majority died from other things that were falsely re-categorized as COVID to help inflate numbers &amp; to promote fear.
