@FFB2xChamp @BradyHenderson @AdamSchefter Either do masks (studies show very little difference when masks are or not used for covid-19), virus is going to virus! But if their are asymptomatic they shouldn't be tested and should be allowed to play! As transmission is also low amongst the asymptomatic.
