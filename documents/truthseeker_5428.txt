@BullDogGrrrl @JordanSchachtel Right. Now clarify whos banning unvaccinated people from going to grocery stores?
Companies like airlines or cruise lines can decide that they want to cater to vaccinated people for the safety of their customers, &amp; shoppers can vote with their wallets. Thats not a ban
