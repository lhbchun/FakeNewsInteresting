@bertzthedestroy @ThomLaPorte @drsimonegold Not true...the childhood vaccine injury act of 1986 has given vaccine manufacturers total immunity from any liability. Prior to that they were spending millions on lawsuits. Then the gov stepped in and gave them free reign for no safety and thus why children have been injured.
