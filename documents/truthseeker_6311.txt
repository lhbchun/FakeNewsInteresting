@ArceusLegend50 @Mitche2600 @Josh78416203 @kiwithesmol False. The vaccines are creating the variants. The "variants" didn't pop up until the "vaccines" started rolling out in droves. The CDC has also changed the definition of the word "vaccine" twice so the Covid-19 shots will fit the definition of a "vaccine".
