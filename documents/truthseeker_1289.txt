@HowdyStranger21 @Yb1962YvonneYc @NBCNews Ok, they're unlucky that they took a vaccine that doesn't prevent transmission. I'll give you that.

Going out into public and not taking additional precautions to prevent spreading it to others, despite knowing the vaccine doesn't prevent transmission, is still negligence.
