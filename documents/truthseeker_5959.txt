@JackRichardso99 @Thee_Roxy_Cox @gnomeicide @glenn_coin @malaconotus @JAGLeMans @Bluesterge2 @lovejoy92 @UKCovid19Stats This virus mutates, seemingly quite readily. The more transmission, the more likely a vaccine-resistant escape variant will develop. Plus you'll subject the unvaccinated to a small risk of death, and a greater risk of long covid.

Pretty heartless.
