@janiechgdparty @ExelyMax @GRITS_562 @DrEricDing Thank you. I too hope theyll come out of it soon. We were doing math when it started &amp; all. It unfortunate this happened. But mad at the same time. Believe in science. Listen to them. I know a few not vaccinated. Thats sad. I stay away. Mask still.
