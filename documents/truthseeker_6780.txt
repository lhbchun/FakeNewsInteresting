@peteilc @Deefrancesjones Asymptomatic spread is believed to account for half of all COVID-19 transmission.

If asymptomatic spread doesnt exist then how do you think Donald Trump got COVID-19?

Do you think someone with obvious symptoms of the virus was allowed to be anywhere near him and his family?
