@MaggieDeBella1 @gi_nif @MichelleCrawl14 @bipglo @condo2009 @Jim_Jordan Check your details. Your source is ALL deaths w/i a set time after vaccine. The rate of those deaths post-vaccine in US is 21 ten-thousandths (.0021%). Those include *all* causes (e.g., Hank Aarons death is one). Pretty safe. Waivers? This is litigious America. Duh.
