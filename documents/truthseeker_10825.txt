@YossiGestetner @Bob_Wachter I was wondering if we'd have a "from/with" difference for vaccine deaths, since there's no distinction in C19 death tallies. But sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Hank Aaron (vaccinated Jan. 6th) died less than three weeks later. So that's a vaccine-related death, yes?
