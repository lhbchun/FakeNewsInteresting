@Flub1957 @TimesRadio @tnewtondunn @IsabelHardman @nadhimzahawi 20 months ago when the waiting lists really climbed and we were in full lockdown nobody was vaccinated, now it's only 4.2m people who are unvaccinated and we have a new variant that seems to have massive vaccine immune escape. It's a totally different situation.
