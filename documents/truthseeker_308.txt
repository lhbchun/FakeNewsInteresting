@IanIdeaman7 @rolandsmartin @funder @PressSec @kayleighmcenany What is sad, Trump supporters will say the numbers are inflated, or the coronavirus is a hoax to make their President look bad. Truthfully, the numbers are confirmed numbers. We don't have real numbers, which could be 2 to 3 times more, due to lack of testing.
