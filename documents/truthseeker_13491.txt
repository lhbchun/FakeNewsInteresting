@grumpyteacher7 @minimaddiiTTV @ThatBillyWilson @BBCNews That's not what I asked.

Scenario:

Person dies of heart attack. Not sick with any respiratory disease. But two weeks ago, tested positive for the common cold, on a PCR test. Not sick though. Just on a test.

Certificate cause of death:  "Common cold."

Does this happen?
