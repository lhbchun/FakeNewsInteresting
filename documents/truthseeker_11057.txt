@Nappingisbomb @Komarus_Huey @dovenymph The same could probably be said about Covid deaths, given that most of them are quite elderly with multiple comorbidities.

BTW, Baseball slugger Hank Aaron just died, two weeks after receiving his Covid vaccine. Im sure it was just a coincidence. No cause of death disclosed.
