@angelalambert14 @woodsharp @tessyursine No but they are going to ramp up their testing to FIND cases. 

The problem is the injected ARE going to die because they have weak immune systems. They will all test positive for covid. 

Stay strong. Its about to get scary for the uninjected that will be blamed.
