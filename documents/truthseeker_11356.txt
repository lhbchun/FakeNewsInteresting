@mariabronn75 @brad_polumbo @mehdirhasan Natural immunity is as good as the vaccine per science. Half your class gets Covid from eating lunch without a mask. Masking the other 6 hours didn't protect them, so why do they have to wear masks? Kids don't need this vaccine, stop listening to politicians &amp; their paid experts.
