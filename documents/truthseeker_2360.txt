@hedgelord2 @DocLT2 @WalshFreedom No, it's sailing over yours. The point is that being vaccinated mean you don't have to wear a mask, so people without masks should be judged as vaccinated, not antivaxxers. Unless you don't believe in science and  judge people based on outdated, false info instead of reality
