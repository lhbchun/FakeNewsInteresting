@edyong209 @cmclymer Every person in an ICU bed that refused a vaccination &amp; then got COVID should be charged with murder if they dont die. They are responsible for this mans death 100%. Ignorance/stupidity are no excuse. Hospitals should start kicking out anti vaxers when bed is needed for others.
