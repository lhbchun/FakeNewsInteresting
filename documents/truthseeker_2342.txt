@TomB1031 @perdidostschool @sfchronicle I just think we need more then just the mask mandate. We need to put pressure on those refuse to get vaccinated. And that is not  childish at all but logical. We will never get out of this if we cower to ppl who do not believe in science. And its my right to be angry at them.
