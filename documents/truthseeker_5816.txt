@RadCentrism @StephenJBeynon @JcBlois @SciencePharmer @HislopMD Huh? Those articles are about variant spread in a largely unvaccinated population, not about the risk of variants achieving immune escape to such an extent that vaccinated people aren't protected from severe disease.

Also the Spiegel article is from a month before that podcast.
