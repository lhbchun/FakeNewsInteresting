@PierreDefecto6 @kasptheshaman @BelleFrancois1 @pokeroot01 @ProjectLincoln @MaryLTrump You know there are spikes in other states too right? Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Arizona, Texas. And yes, testing here right now is more extensive, but we also have a larger population than a lot of countries, and dont as much testing per capita.
