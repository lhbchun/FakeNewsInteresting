@Whitediculous @johnny333tears The vaccine won't 100% prevent you from having or spreading covid. It'll lower the chances though.
But most of all, it lowers your chances of developing mortal symptoms or having sequels.
Atm the vaccine is not there to kill the virus but to turn it into a more begnin sickness.
