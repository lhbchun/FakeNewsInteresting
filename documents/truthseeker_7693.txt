@AlabasterBlast1 @JodieHMoss @thehill I had never been anti-vax. Both my children received all their inoculations. But, I have done some research on the subject once I found out congress gave vaccine mfg exemption of liability back in 1986. If you dig deep enough, you'll find the rise of autism starts there.
