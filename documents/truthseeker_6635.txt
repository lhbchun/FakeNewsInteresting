@McGoozzo @Serendipity3197 @RWMaloneMD Actually there were no known Covid-19 variants prior to the introduction of the vaccine, but that's not even relevant.  The point is that viruses mutate to get around the body's immune response.  Vaccines accelerate that process by creating the necessity for them to do so.
