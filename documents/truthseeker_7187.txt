@bronxilla @D_Elms @coastal_eddyLB @OldCoastie54 @atrupar A Covid-19 infection is not binary. Its not that youre either uninfected or dead.

More to the point is asymptomatic transmission (hence lockdowns) and the consumption of finite hospital resources, causing other conditions to not be treated. Youre also ignoring long Covid.
