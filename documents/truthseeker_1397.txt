@galarza_mr @MatthewVeasey @ChristaScalise Your vaccination only protects you (possibly) from severe illness or death.  It does not prevent you from being infected or spreading that infection to others.  It does not prevent mutations.  That is why vaccine mandates are useless.  This is basic science.
