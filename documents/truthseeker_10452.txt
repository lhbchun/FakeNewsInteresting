@tomcoates @kelly_holmes00 @elonmusk Lies. Those outrageous death rates are artificially inflated. The CDC shot themselves in the foot by creating a financial incentive to inflate covid death counts, so may never truely know how deadly the virus has been. Look at global statistics for more accurate numbers.
