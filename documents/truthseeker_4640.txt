@nickwallace7 @gonzales_isiaha @Vorz16 @SolofJoshxbox @RapSheet Nick.... maybe you need to check out what HIPAA is(you spelled it wrong... like most on internet). It's privacy laws only concern the health care industry. Your employer is allowed to ask about your vaccination status.  HIPAA does not prevent this. Do a little research
