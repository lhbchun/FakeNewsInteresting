@GhostRunnrOn3rd @kinsellawarren That's not true. Why are all the professional sports leagues, with 99% vaccination rates being overrun with covid? Vaccinated can transmit and get Covid. Why submit, not to a vaccine, but to an mRnA gene therapy? Talk to me in five years when your "vaccine has done it's work.
