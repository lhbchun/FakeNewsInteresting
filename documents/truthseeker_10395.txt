@ChrisSturr @DonnaLynnNH You believe the COVID death count. We know hospitals are doing everything they can to inflate those numbers. CDC says about 6% died who didn't have multiple comorbidities. VAERS damages are off the charts. You are probably more likely to end up with side effects from the vax.
