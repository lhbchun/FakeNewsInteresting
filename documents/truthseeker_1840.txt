@returnoftoasty @cardinals150 @flopperdog @Olivianuzzi I am a little skeptical.  We were told, We wont take it because its not fully approved. Pfizer has been fully approved but they moved the goalposts again.  Im unwilling to budge any further.  Not without a guarantee you will take the vaccine if you get X, Y and Z.
