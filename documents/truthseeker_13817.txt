@deliakradolfer @RRRndll @MatthewJshow @realDonaldTrump We are blaming him. Saturday, July 4th- Trump claimed: 99% of COVID-19 cases are totally harmless. Lies!! COVID can still cause tremendous suffering if it doesnt kill a patient, about 15 percent of COVID-19 cases can be severe, with 5 percent being critical. He killed 210k.
