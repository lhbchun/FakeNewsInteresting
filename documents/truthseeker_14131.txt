@BritchesFuzzy @lapublichealth Cases are going up because people are not adhering to the strict mask mandates. NYC is testing 2 1/2 times that L.A. County per day and their positivity rate is 1.8%. They are only averaging 600 infections per day at that high number of test. Their people are just more vigilant.
