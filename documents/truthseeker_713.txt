@WhinterQueen @languagewitch_ @dansolomon @chick_in_kiev I certainly agree we need way more testing per capita to get back to "normal." But Texas isn't jumping right back to normal. Bars will remain closed. Restaurants and theaters at 25% capacity, disposable menus and small parties only, swimming pools still closed, etc.
