@RavBogard @edgeoforever I'm Jewish and  refuse to get vaccinated.  Here is why: 1. I had Covid 19 and still have antibodies 2. I donate convalescent plasma (waiting on giving 2nd donation).  If I get vaccine, I can't donate.    It is my responsibility to help others by donating plasma with antibodies
