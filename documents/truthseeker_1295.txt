@camorris @Supermanssidek2 @JonnMcDaniel @catturd2 How would this be 'wrapped up"?
The vaccine doesn't prevent you from spreading it or getting it.  Doesn't lessen the spread between vaxxed ppl.
It only lessens the severity of the illness.

Why are you against ppl making their own decisions and for mandates, that have not worked?
