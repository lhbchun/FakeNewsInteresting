@NateStan99 @JackPosobiec @pfizer That would be true of this were a vaccine. It is not. It is mRNA gene therapy that in no way relates to a classic vaccine. This is purely experimental technology that has never been put in a human body til now. Over the last 20 years the FDA never approved human trials. WAKE UP!
