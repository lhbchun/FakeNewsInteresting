@ThatRyanChap @JamesWard73 Was thinking about this in terms of 'escape' variants. If they are at R0.62 for the given level of NPIs. You would need a variant that escapes, for the purposes of infection, ~40% of the people vaccinated (It will be more than this as current numbers driven by unvaccinated).
