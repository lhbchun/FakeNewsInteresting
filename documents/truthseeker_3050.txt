@roytotten @yibbiy @AreOhEssEyeEe Why is this happening is the missing question. MRNA is not vaccine its experimental gene therapy. It only reduces the symptoms related to the strain used to create it (eg) Pfizer. You are still able to contract every variant and mutation. So it can never work. Virus mutates.
