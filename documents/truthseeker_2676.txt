@jaredbfox @JTSEO9 @GreekFire23 False analogy. Historically this isn't a vaccine. Vaccines contain live or attenuated strains from which immunity is boosted. The COVID shot is instead a mutable mRNA gene therapy designed to permanently modify your DNA forcing it to emulate what they think COVID might look like.
