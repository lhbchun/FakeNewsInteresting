@LaurensCloete @stefandeklerk91 @SolidarityRSA Think of this if you tested positive for CV, from a test that cannot distinguish between, a common cold, flu, N1h1, mers, swine flu or CV, nor a dead or live cell, and died, irrespective of cause with 28 days, it's CV. Die of covid within 14 days of a  jab, it's a CV death.
