@buck_lao @attorneyconrad @mag09176505 @10TV CDC has officially acknowledged that it has quietly created a new mortality category : PIC, which groups Pneumonia and Influenza and Covid together... and reports them all as Covid deaths. This new classification gives the CDC the ability to inflate covid-19 mortality numbers.
