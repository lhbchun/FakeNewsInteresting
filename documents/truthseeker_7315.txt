@Shadyhugs @MichaelCoudrey If mandatory injections for children (vaccines) are so safe why:

-Has there been over $4 billion in payouts since 1986 for permanent damages caused by vaccines?

-Why are vaccine manufactures EXEMPT FROM LIABILITY?

-Why are there tax-payer funded Vaccine Courts?

Ill wait.
