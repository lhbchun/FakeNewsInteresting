@mtclaud @Morning_Joe @pbump Pelosi in charge of the interrogation? First one found nothing, second one she controls which Capitol Police can testify? So far Big Smoke screen and they haven't found nothing. What's going on? She wouldn't let the certain govt officials talk. General Honore found nothing? WTF?
