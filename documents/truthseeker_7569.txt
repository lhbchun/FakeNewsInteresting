@Blahtablah @Alyssa_Milano @jorge1207 Vaccine producers almost went bankrupt in the 80s from the families winning lawsuits because of their dead or injured children.  So in 1986 Ronald Reagan eliminated all liability.  Now us tax payers pay out the millions each year that parents are winning in vaccine court.
