@DawnChristine2 @Amber_Khan1 @DrGJackBrown It's sad. I live in South Texas, hildago County where the camps are. We have the lowest testing and highest death rate per capita maybe anywhere. The only reason there's space at the hospital now is because 2,000 people died in the last couple months just in   my county.
