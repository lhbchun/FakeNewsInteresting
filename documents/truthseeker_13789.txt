@funmidniterider @Jette680News What do you mean? You don't have time to read the science? How do you know that what you're reading online is factual if you don't verify it with multiple sources? For example, when DT stated at Mt Rushmore that 99 percent covid 19 cases are harmless, did you believe or verify?
