@kgndesign @annda28937441 @SaintLapsed @jasonleitch I know the harms will transcend coronavirus. deaths from suicide, cancer, poverty, homelessness etc are now becoming incalculable. I want more evidence than Ive been given! That is my right! 25000 people died in Scotland 2 years ago. Of flu! Dont hear much about that!
