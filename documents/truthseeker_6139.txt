@deathdenial @NicolaSturgeon @ScotParl You do realise that the S African variant was found in 4 vaccinated ppl first, don't you?
There is no evidence to support that unvaccinated contributes more than vaccinated in the spread. There is mounting evidence to show that the spike is evolving to escape the vaccine tho!
