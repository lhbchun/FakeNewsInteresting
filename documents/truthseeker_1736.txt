@mcnabbd @_WithAnS @RepThomasMassie So when the FDA officially approved Pfizer's vaccine, if there did not extend the EUA at the same time, the existing stock of vaccines made before approval would have been unusable. It's just a result of the laws and regulations not being built to handle this specific scenario.
