@Wesley_Hayes99 @pdagr8one @flamingogiant @xoxocoffee_ @BigEsqBae Human trials were funded in 2020 the mRNA vaccine has existed since 2000.  The measles vaccine took 4?years in 1973.  Technology has advanced a lot since then.  You dont want the vaccine fine,  but you should not get healthcare priority either when you get the virus. Period.
