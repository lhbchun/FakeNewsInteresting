@davidchapman141 @AirBossUT5 Except he didn't say "Hospitals do get more money for Covid deaths". 

He said:
"our doctors get more money if someone dies from Covid,...when in doubt choose Covid.

He may have meant hospitals, but he said "doctors". And Doctors are working hard/helping people. Bad look
