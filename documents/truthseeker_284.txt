@LuceResists @BrunoAmato_1 Don't forget Trump told them to SLOW THE CORONAVIRUS TESTING DOWN and stop reporting the total number of Covid cases AND DEATHS because it made him look bad and stopped Covid pandemic daily briefings. 
Trump CARED LESS ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE SUFFERING AND DYING. He played golf.
