@eaglefeet7 @Wx_Jordan22 @FamilyGuyonFOX Its not generational to be greedy.  I hope at least you wear a mask.  I got vaccinated and wear a mask for myself, my family, my friends and  anyone I interact with.  I believe in science and know not to listen to people who arent experts and take bacteria drugs for a virus
