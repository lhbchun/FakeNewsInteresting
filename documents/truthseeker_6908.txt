@Grandpa21121 @Noursepatty @GretaThunberg If you know a strong, peer reviewed study showing that asymptomatic transmission is an actuality, please share. Otherwise, anyone with Covid-19, stay home. don't put others at risk. I don't think there are adequate studies showing safety of the vaccine for children.
