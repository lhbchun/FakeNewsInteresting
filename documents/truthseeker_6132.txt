@maxxx__power @dannypgh @page88 @gtconway3d In Canada we are at 82% fully vaccinated and almost 90% partially vaxxed and the Delta variant is still causing massive infection in the unvaccinated. I think it is going to have to be 95%+ to really be effective (barring any new variants that can escape vaccine effectiveness).
