@Elixabef @kylegriffin1 Not really....you are free to mask up for added protection, but I am healthy and vaccinated and shouldn't have to wear a mask. I believe in data and science, I am not going to suffer from covid. I don't interact with anyone else children. There is no reason 4 me to wear a mask.
