@AnxNeckGames @ginacarano The CDC JUST said vaccinated people help variants along via immune escape.  Come on man, a virus that replicates with less resistance as is the case in unvaccinated folks will not need to select for mutations that help it escape the immune response.  Vaccine made Delta variant.
