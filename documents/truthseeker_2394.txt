@10dollarstud @MAJDefcon1 @weldanator1 @spinjsteele @ChristosArgyrop Evidently, you don't believe in science or statistics. The problem is that unvaccinated people are not wearing mask. In my town the vast majority aren't wearing masks. I'd say over 95% are Maskless. Only 30% in our county are fully vaccinated. Do the math.
