@agfan1965 @Madelin92879767 @TeddyFeed Incorrect. Anyone can ask for your vaccination status. Anyone can respond with their vaxx status. Or you can refuse. If you refuse to respond, they can refuse to hire, allow entry, excuse work absence, etc. 

HIPAA means Med Profs can't release your med info w/o your consent.
