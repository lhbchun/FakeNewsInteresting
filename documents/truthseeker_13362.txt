@dpvpinBuffalo @markpoloncarz @NewsRadio930 And so, you were right that the CDC said as such, but again, it's not the antibody but errors in testing, "Some tests may exhibit *cross-reactivity* with other coronaviruses, such as those that cause the common cold. This could result in false-positive test results."
