@sivakumarmuthu @VincentRK @BDUTT The issue is not the inability to test the ridiculously high population of India. Cases are going down because Delhi and Mumbai and other hot spot cities are locked  down. There is little testing in rural areas. Infected and dead in those areas are not counted. Wake up!
