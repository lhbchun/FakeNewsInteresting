@lifestream87 @jkwan_md Monday and Tuesday always have very low test numbers, because they're reporting tests from the weekend when there's fewer testing slots. But generally speaking, more serious cases are still going to get tested on weekends so it spikes the +%. It's still up from last Monday tho.
