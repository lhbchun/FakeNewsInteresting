@ladykmw @GBNEWS @charlie_lawson1 Somebody catches Covid.

They recover.

They now have Natural Immunity.

Natural Immunity is better than Vaccine Immunity.

It is stronger and lasts longer.

They do not need the Vaccine.

They decline it.

How is that selfish?

And there are millions in this situation.
