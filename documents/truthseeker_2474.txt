@Joseph_Joe_M @patriottakes I believe in science; I'm fully vaccinated, but also know that I COULD still catch it (again) I follow safety guidelines &amp; CONTINUE to mask to protect myself, AND others, regardless if it's optional, required, or NOT. We agree, this is NOT a political issue, but a HEALTH issue.
