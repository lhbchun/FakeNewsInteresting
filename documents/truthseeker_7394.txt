@kevinault @LCimasoni @mcfunny @doritmi @FormerAntivax @crabb_vicki @GretchenLasalle CDC reclassified 33,000 cases of polio in 1 day and ooppps AFM, GBS all considered polio prior to reclassification ! We disagree ! Even if a vaccine potentially may help the harm we have seen in the children since 1986 forward is just to great ! Children are sicker than ever !
