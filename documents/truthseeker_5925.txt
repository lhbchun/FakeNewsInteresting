@jlaorganbuilder @amateuradam Not so. A study from Israel shows better immunity from previous infection vs vaccine. Now we are largely vaccinated, we need Covid to circulate so the unvaccinated become immune too.

Otherwise a deadlier / vaccine escape variant will appear and be WORSE for the vulnerable.
