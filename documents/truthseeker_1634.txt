@RichardMRosent1 @mtracey 20 American kids die of COVID every week (that's one Sandy Hook a week), and many others bring COVID home and infect their families. It's the risk of myocarditis that's zero. What possible reason is there for opposing vaccination besides wanting to murder kids &amp; families?
