@Nadia04942693 @kunalpanchal @Maribeaut @TennisPuneet @AmethystShining @DDFTennis Natural immunity as a preference to getting vaccinated (when a vaccine is available) is misguided. Covid comes with far more potential harm than the vaccine. So yes, following the science would still lead someone to get vaccinated.
