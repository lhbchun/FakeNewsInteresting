@jermrs @collectoritis @dw1776 @BrandiLynn4Ever @BNODesk This is a lie. Young people are far more likely to die of influenza infection, automobile accident, or suicide (among others) than from sarscov2 infection. Perhaps the zealous (over)publication of nearly every young/healthy fatality from coronavirus has given you a bias.
