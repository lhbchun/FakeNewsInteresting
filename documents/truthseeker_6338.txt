@DavidLWindt @grahamelwood @jimmy_dore @miserablelib People were getting sick from COVID-19 even before the vaccines were available. If your argument is that vaccines are creating new variants because the only way to get a variant is by getting sick after having been vaccinated, you are wrong. It was already possible before.
