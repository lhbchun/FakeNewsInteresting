@Disco_6T7 @ezralevant Yeah for the largest in history experiment on humans. All mRNA vaccines in use in the USA are still listed by the FDA as  "emergency use, experimental".  Not one dose of the FDA approved Pfizer vaccine has been given in the USA, they are waiting for FDA approval to use on kids.
