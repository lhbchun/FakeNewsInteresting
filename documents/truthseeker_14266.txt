@Garroth70291111 @AndrewYang Thanks for proving my point. Cases are going up largely because were testing more people (many of those tests false positives FYI). Cases dont tell the real picture, tell your math wizard to do math on hospitalizations and deaths and stop preaching panic like rest of the herd.
