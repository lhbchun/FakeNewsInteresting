@CCBlaze @laurenboebert Fauci said"Masks don't give as much protection as people think they do." If vaccines work so well, why do folks have to wear masks ( that don't work well) to protect the vaccinated? Think - " they" want to scare us; so "they" can control us. Use therapeutics (regeneron)and live.
