@flickhan @4yearsofprotest @KayeSteinsapir No vaccine is 100% and efficacy is lower with the Delta variant, but if enough people are vaccinated, the virus runs out of places to go. Additionally, unvaccinated people lead to more and stronger variants that may escape vaccines completely. But guessing you dont care.
