@realpaulnelson1 @MartinHeinrich That isn't remotely true.  They run out of tests every day, and the rules are quite strict (recorded contact with somebody known to have C-19 positive test is required).  We're closer than most states -- we have 20 per case, most have 10-12 -- but we need 50 to track the disease.
