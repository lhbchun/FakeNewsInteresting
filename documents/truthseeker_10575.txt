@butch_henry @vhogan52 @POTUS The vaccines weren't from trump, he had a horrible vaccine plan. Biden hasn't raised taxes for the rich(yet) and food prices haven't gone up except for natural fluctuations. 20 million people lost their jobs over Trump. But no name calling, either. Glad you're appreciative.
