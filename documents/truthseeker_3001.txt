@TimothyBuffett @seglow137 @scramble_nft @chainyoda @Wikipedia No, the Covid vaccines are *not* similar to the flu shot. The Covid jab was described by Pfizer in its docs as gene therapy; that is what it is. It is mRNA that train the body to produce spike proteins. They literally had to redefine "vaccine" in order call this a vaccine.
