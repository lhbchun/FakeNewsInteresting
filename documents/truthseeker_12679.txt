@TALHAHBEL @tigersowners When they die of what?  I'll be much more angry if someone dies of suicide, drug overdose, or depression and hopelessness than I will if I find out that a death was caused by the Wuhan Coronavirus, Influenza, or gunshot.  It is what it is, except when the government is the cause.
