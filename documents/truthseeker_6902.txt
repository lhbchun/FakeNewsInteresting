@JaimelwinnL @alainashearer Cant view any study in isolation. Covid 19 keeps changing so its best to track it. It does seem that asymptomatic and symptomatic transmission is less of a problem with the vaccinated, but the longer Covid spreads around, the more it mutates to survive. Search immune escape.
