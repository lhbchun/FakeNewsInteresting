@Charles48KY @BobBeauBowman1 @slowyknows2 @KevinH85539981 @POTUS You're apparently conflating someone supporting Trump (who pushes the vaccine), with anti-vax'ers. Then you're stating that because they're not vaxed, they spread the virus. The vax does not prevent you from contracting or spreading the virus. You're just trying to scapegoat.
