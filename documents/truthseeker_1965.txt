@IgnisEternus @Brammer99 @BernieSanders Yes &amp; No.  Comirnaty is FDA approved, but not yet available in the U.S.  Pfizer-BioNTech is still available under EUA, and will continue to be available under EUA till the vials expire or are used up. The products are "legally distinct". It's not the same vaccine.
