@bit_mandelstam @DeItaone lol not sure how that bolsters your assertion in any way. Trump never encouraged getting vaccinated. In fact he continues to cast doubt on the vaccines. Instead he encouraged ingesting bleach. Trump also said it was just the flu that it would go away completely by April 2020.
