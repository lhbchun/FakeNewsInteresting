@ANerdySocialist @eternalskeptic2 @robertschueller @RicciGeri Anti-vaccine?  Or, anti-stupid?!  I'm the latter.  The vaccine does not prevent contracting COVID19.  It does not prevent spreading the virus.  The vaccine does not prevent death.   Knowing those true scientific facts, it would be stupid to inject yourself with a useless vaccine.
