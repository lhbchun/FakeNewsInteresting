@homolog_us @PhillipCompeau It's not an "experimental medicine". It's been extensively tested for safety &amp; efficacy, and is approved by the FDA. Requirement of an approved vaccine for a workplace has nothing to do w/ forced experimentation without consent. So no, it's not a violation of the Nuremberg code.
