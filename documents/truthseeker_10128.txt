@EoinOConnell87 @denisrancourt that has always been my question. how do we verify any of these numbers given by central authorities such as the CDC etc...
we have to assume that whatever numbers they give are true. if they can deflate the deaths from the vaccines, then they can inflate the deaths from COVID.
