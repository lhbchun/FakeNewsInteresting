@mfwilliard @Marina_Sirtis @realDonaldTrump FYI Texas is the 15th deadliest per capita as of 7 days ago.
Ranked 23 in cases/cap
Testing/cap it ranked a super low 41.
Testing performance that low means both cases and deaths are under reported.
Texas "Excess deaths" not explainable without Covid - off their morbity charts
