@oakfan71 @MichaelScolieri @GovMikeDeWine What's sad is you think they are inflating the covid death counts. Trump told all hospitals to stop sending their data to the CDC who was publishing them publicly. Now Trump controls the reporting.

But you think Trump did that to inflate, not hide, the real numbers...
