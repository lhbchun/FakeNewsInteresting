@purplerubble @mllichti @nbeaudrot @1966_andallthat This is a form of the post hoc fallacy. Just because numbers are going up, doesnt mean the tests arent preventing them from going up even higher. Youll find that higher testing in Western Europe comes hand in hand with lower deaths/capita *and* as proportion of cases.
