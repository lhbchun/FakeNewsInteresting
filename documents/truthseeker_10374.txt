@Elemenatore @DopeThingsNick @JamieThxmson @tyleroakley @jakepaul Also the CDC themselves have stated that the numbers they give out dont give an accurate measure on who has covid because you cant test EVERY SINGLE PERSON and the amount of asymptomatic people rise everyday. They dont inflate it just to scare its a precautionary measure.
