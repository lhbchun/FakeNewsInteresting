@Mpeek71 @kot_dub @Annabel_Jones_ @Rooskiebrooski @matthewdmarsden The vaccine did work as intended for the initial variants. With new variants we got lucky there was crossover protection. Also, natural immunity fades over time with COVID just like the vaccines. We could go on &amp; on. Point is, different virus, different variants, it all matters.
