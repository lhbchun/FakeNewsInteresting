@spurlockdylany1 @IdealistRyan @heyojanna @GavinNewsom No, this is incorrect. You have to look at deaths per capita, i.e. accounting for population. CA has more people, therefore more deaths and cases. But per capita, TX has way higher deaths. Further, Texas is testing at a LOWER rate than CA, and BOTH are significantly below target.
