@angler_texas @LeeSmithDC @molmccann @FDRLST Okay. However, as I had mentioned, a lot of states not accurately reporting infections (that is what builds CDC data). Hence the issue. Also, only 35 states report infections in prisons and long term care facilities. As for testing, it's better, but per capita, it is low.
