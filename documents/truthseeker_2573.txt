@RobertIField @drexelpubhealth @DrexelKline @DrexelNews My patience is wearing thin with vaccinated anti maskersthey need to look in the mirror &amp; say what they said about anti maskers last year. Not masking is selfish. Especially by the informed science crowd. They believe the risks, just wont mask cuz theyre not at risk. #gross
