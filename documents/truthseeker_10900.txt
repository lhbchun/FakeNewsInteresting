@LukeMincey @MichaelProcton @SimmJonny @wolfonthehill @kljohnston5743 @Stu_Murray1 @NCAA Correlation doesnt equal causation. Remember Hank Aaron? Died a couple weeks after getting the vaccine. He was almost 90 years old. If the vaccine was truly causing deaths, youd see a lot more than 3,000ish deaths out of millions. COVID has a higher death rate than that.
