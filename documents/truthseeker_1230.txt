@james_mclamb @bbdfl @ericjem7 @JoeBiden Then why are cases up 200% since the vaccine was released? It's still in a trial phase and is more like a flu shot than a traditional immunization. Immunizations PREVENT infection. This vaccine doesn't prevent catching it, spreading it or even dying from it. Not worth the risk.
