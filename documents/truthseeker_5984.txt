@girlonavespa21 @Nigel_StHubbins @adater Babies dont get sick of COVID. This is insane. And who cares if unvaccinated people get it? They arent worried about it. Let them make their own choices. Ive got news, every variant will escape the vaccine because they dont stop infection or transmission anyway. Never did.
