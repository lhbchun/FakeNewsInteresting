@AllenKWPaley @anbayanyay @CTVCalgary 2 things at play, one is declining immunity over time (a minor factor), the other is immune escape with a new variant. Boosters help. Either way, the data clearly show that vaccinated is better than unvaccinated by such a huge margin that declining immunity isnt the big issue.
