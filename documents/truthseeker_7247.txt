@aha002 @JuneauRocky @globalnews I'll repeat... these shots don't prevent infection or transmission of the virus SARS-COV-2. They "may" prevent clinical expression of the disease COVID-19. No symptoms = no testing = no cases attributed to Vx'd ppl.

They do however become asymptomatic superspreaders.
