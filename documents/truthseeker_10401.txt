@mitchellvii @SidneyPowell1 How many flu deaths were reported as Covid to inflate the numbers? The CDC is inflating the number of Covid new cases as they miss count both actual cases and those with the antibodies in their totals. Most every statistic we get about this is not true. Panic is to control us!!!!
