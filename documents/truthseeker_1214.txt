@Gamblet22 @tyra_favara @haileybanack @CogNerd Again, unsurprisingly,  you're missing the point. It doesn't confer immunity or prevent spreading to others, so it's NOT a vaccine. It's an EUA treatment option that shouldn't be forced on ppl. Compare to polio or MMR vax. Do ppl contract/spread polio? No cuz those are true vaxs.
