@tjw1983 @BoSnerdley @nypmetro You can't get natural immunity unless you first get COVID, which may kill you.

What vaccine has "therapeutics"?

Support your claim of "99.008% survivable virus."

"it's and exception." WHAT?

"Look it up" is code for "I'm making an unsupported claim, so go waste your time."
