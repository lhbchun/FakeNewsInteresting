@michellegreer @TattonTreks This data set shows 37% more cases per capita in Texas with the Texas cases much less deadly as both states have nearly same deaths per population.

I wouldn't call that Texas fail. Very hard to measure case rates across borders with different testing, i.e. symptomatic only (1/2)
