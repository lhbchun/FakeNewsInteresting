@kmerian @TMGBiosciences @MackayIM @SMacMillanMD It's a personal choice what medication to take. 

If vaccines are safe, why do we have The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986?

If vaccines are needed, people would take them. No one wants their children to die. The risks are just not there anymore in US.
