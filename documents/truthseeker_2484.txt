@ForgedinFire20 @Cherylafullert1 @Kate17Kazoo I am willing to mask for every child that can't be vaccinated but not for the idiots that refuse to help end the pandemic by refusing it. The same idiots are running to hospitals to help them when they get sick. If they don't believe the science in the vax why go to the hospital?
