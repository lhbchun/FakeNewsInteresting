@ILikeDucks01 @PaulEire1776 @IrishTimes Maybe miniscule in each individual vaccine. But how much is being administered over the full schedule? Plus ingesting aluminum would have to pass through stomach acids. Most vaccines are injected so pass directly into the blood and can travel freely to the brain.
