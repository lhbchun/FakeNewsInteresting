@DialecticSapien @rose_indu @ShekharGupta No states were doing covid tests after death, period... I just gave one of my personal experience.  Only now Kerala is reporting more than 100 deaths per day.  No of cases are more less same for the past 2-3 months and then the deaths were less than 50.  How is that?
