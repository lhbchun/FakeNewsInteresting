@GavinC86 @macrobubble @Thorpy1Thorpy @ewieisunited @PaulMcCartney You asked about deaths. People die with the vaccine. You have a 99.9% survival rate with the vaccine and a 99.8% survival rate without the vax. Not to mention people like Hank Aaron who was not counted as a death from the vaccine when he died two weeks after getting it.
