@DannyTHughes @NinaGottschalk2 @SecondCityCop Your assertion could NOT be true. 31% of the American people had already had covid &amp; recovered before the vaccines were widely available. You, along w/ the vaccine pushers, are attributing immunity to a vaccine when it could've been natural immunity offering the best protection.
