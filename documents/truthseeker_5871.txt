@KLAAS777 @goat_qi @empathicpolitic @thehill Viral escape only happens when the virus develops mutations. It only does this because it can survive and replicate in the unvaccinated. 

The Delta variant is more virulent amongst yall. There is the occasional breakthrough case, but the virus is not escaping.

Vax still works.
