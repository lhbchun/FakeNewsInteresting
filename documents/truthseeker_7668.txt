@joshkeaton @TheEricGoldman Vaccine injuries are not rare, I suppose it could be called a trend. Take time to research. Over $4 billion of our tax dollars has been paid to compensate families of injured or dead children from vaccines. Manufacturers are not liable for injury. Look up 1986 NVICA. #sadreality
