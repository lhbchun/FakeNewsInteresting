@NickTorfaen @GarethThomasMP @guardian These vaccines are experimental as all phase trial didn't get completed! They most certainly weren't trialed with boosters within a year as well! MRNA is not a vaccine, it's gene therapy and NOT like anything that we've had before! Where's all the data on natural immunity????
