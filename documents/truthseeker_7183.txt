@ClareMcGinn @JosCreese @marksandspencer It says A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is via respiratory particles, and it is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic, paucisymptomatic, and asymptomatic individuals this has been debunked sooo many times. People with no symptoms spread nothing.
