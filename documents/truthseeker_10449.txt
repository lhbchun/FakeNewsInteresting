@petemuntean @DanielleWoodsTV Is there any truth to what I hear that all those who said they had been in contact with a covid patient are being counted as covid pos by hospitals &amp; insurance co. to get FED funds? Does this inflate CDC numbers? Is this what AA responds to? Is this why POTUS cut out the CDC?
