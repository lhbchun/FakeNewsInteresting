@naomi9867 @ashleighcolls @RhiannonEFC18 @amee_townsend @katiexlouu Youre going on about it and weve already stated our point. More people are dying from suicide than coronavirus. Suffering with mental health is bad enough but its even worse in a time like this n quite clearly the government dont care. I dont want another reply from you
