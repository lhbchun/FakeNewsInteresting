@Abdulla49982994 @nmmraza @nilufernilar @NewsWireLK That is not true. He never said to drink bleach, that was a lie. Trump got vaccinated in January and he encouraged people to take the vaccine because it works. He put billions to develop the vaccine it defies logic for him not to endorse it. Your hatred of Trump blinds you.
