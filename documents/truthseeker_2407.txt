@cahtaahaht @PivWrld @JacobyFC @PaulGonzalez10 @RapSheet Im vaccinated and wear a mask, it's not because I don't believe the vaccination works. I believe in the science behind both. It's because  there's still rules in place requiring people to wear a mask, and because it's a courtesy to others around me who don't know I'm vaccinated.
