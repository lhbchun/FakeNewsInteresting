@DAE1776 @RabbitohJag @kjosno @thehill At the time 3/4/2020 there were 14 confirmed Covid-19 deaths in the USA. Scientists became aware of asymptomatic transmission soon after. Which is the other reason Dr. Fauci mentioned for the change, which you conveniently left out.  A month later CDC changed guideline on masks.
