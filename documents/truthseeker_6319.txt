@Nicky24643754 @GovDanMcKee You missed the point.Nurses and CNAs who worked many,many hours to take care of ill patients when the "the pandemic" started with no vaccines and PPE but today the PPE isn't  enough. Vaccines are causing variants,vaccines are creating super spreaders . COVID-19 99.7 SURVIVABLE.
