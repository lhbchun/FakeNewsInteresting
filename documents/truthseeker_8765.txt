@FrznShrew @mercywarren76 @regulator062 @GovRonDuhSantis @GovRonDeSantis @Oooooo_Donna Interesting article. Thank you. I dont have anyone in my family with AD. Researchers found significant amounts of aluminum content in brain tissue from donors with familial AD. So I guess we arent going to discuss the covid vaccine?
