@American_486 @AlisonBoxxer @NikkiFried Yep, even the common cold will give a positive COVID result with the PCR tests and genome sequencing is the only way to tell which variant, the PCR test can't.  Even the antibodies those who had it months ago have can cause a false positive. Case numbers are meaningless.
