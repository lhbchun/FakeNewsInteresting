@fungistobewith @Deefrancesjones Vax with Covid-19 Vx does not halt transmission, that is propaganda. The reason transmission has slowed is mainly due to background herd immunity giving real protection. There is no evidence asymptomatic carriers cause infection - virulence of infection depends on viral load!
