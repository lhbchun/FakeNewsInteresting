@Mister__Froggy @soloyochapin @HKrassenstein @realDonaldTrump @JoeBiden Yes. They go off of reports from doctors. The more Covid deaths the doctors report. The more money they receive. Hospitals have admitted to the public saying that If even someone has Covid but dies of a car accident that their death is still counted as a Covid death.
