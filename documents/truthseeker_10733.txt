@JayDX61591613 @dead_common @mushpurple1 @LezMCFC @oXxRowanxXo @jamesReloaded_ Hank Aaron is an easy example

He was ruled not a vaccine death by the CDC, media, etc.   

He died just a couple weeks after getting the vaccine, (to prove they were safe lol)

If he had got covid, without a single symptom, and died, it wouldve been counted as a covid death
