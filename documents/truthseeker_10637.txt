@CodyHatt509 @wurzer @JoshHardwick15 @MarinerMuse Yes, still applies. Also applies for the vaccine, the manufacturers have been caught saying the general public is going to need booster shots because they have no idea how long it is going to last. Side effects include death (Hank Aaron died shortly after getting his 2nd shot)
