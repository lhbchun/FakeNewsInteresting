@ThomasGJameson1 @JohnBasilone20 @freedonomics77 @ElectionWiz No, I'm not kidding you.  And yes, all the safety trials.

Pfizer's vaccine is fully approved for adults (16+), and full approval for under-16 is pending.

Moderna has submitted for full approval, and should have a decision this month, unless there's delays in the review process.
