@TheFinalSteve76 @WendyCerne @mtracey PCR tests can only tell if someone is positive or negative for a coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, flu, covid, SARS, etc. A positive Corona test simply means you have one of these various viruses.
