@MattCugini @tedcruz There's a difference between whether or not a virus is spreading &amp; whether or not a vaccine works.  Even if the virus is rampant, especially when a virus is rampant, an effective vaccine will prevent the people vaccinated from getting it.  That is not what is happening here.
