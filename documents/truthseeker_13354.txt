@CT_Preppy_Witch @LorenCollins @RepThomasMassie I had Covid because I got a positive antibody test, and I didnt even notice it.  I feel perfectly fine now too just like always.  The theory is that prior exposure to the 4 coronaviruses that cause the common cold confers immunity as they share some of the same proteins as Covid
