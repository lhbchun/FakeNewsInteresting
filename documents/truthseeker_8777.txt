@alexjacyy @LUXSkinStudio @keithlaw @Voices4Vaccines @PeterHotez I appreciate the link to the study. Their findings are interesting, but they provide no direct link between the aluminum used as a vaccine adjuvant and the aluminum found in brain tissues. Infants receive more aluminum in their diets than in vaccines.
