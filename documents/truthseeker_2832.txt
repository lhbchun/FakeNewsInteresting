@Andyblease1 @GullyJudith @Jonathan_Witt Absolutely correct here - the mRNA vaccine doesnt alter DNA. Its not a gene therapy. The mRNA instructs cells on how to make a new protein- its a set of instructions that are read by protein factories  (ribosomes) to make new proteins. In this case the S1/S2 spike protein.
