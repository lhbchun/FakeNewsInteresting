@aspiringrebel @BrianESimpson1 Anyone whod rather have COVID-19 than get vaccinated is taking two gambles: that immunity will stick around, and that symptoms wont. Its uncertain for both. And SARS is quite different too (no asymptomatic transmission so it was stopped by people staying home when sick).
