@IndepdentGeorge @maemdoluno @HeartlandSignal The survival rate for Covid was already higher than 99% in all those that caught it and that was before we even had a vaccine.

What you just tweeted is totally ridiculous. Natural immunity has proven to be up more effective in preventing Covid than vaccine induced immunity.
