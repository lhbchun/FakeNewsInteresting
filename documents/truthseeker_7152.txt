@BrockBlakely @mpodg @SportsGurl87 in january of 2020 asymptomatic transmission of covid-19 was documented, and there was prior knowledge that sars was also asymptomatic. preventing a mask shortage makes sense on a public scale, but him stating in private emails that masks are ineffective is a different story imo
