@romanemperor11 @BidenPatient @NadrakupNorth @silverhazey_ @elforesto I feel extremely strongly that people should get vaccinated. I also feel that it's inappropriate for random strangers on Twitter to insist that a distraught person tell them his wife's vaccination status. Not because of HIPAAbecause it's rude.
