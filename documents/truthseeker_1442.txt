@ToothlessGrand1 @PWrenusa @CleatTanner @angrybklynmom The vaccine did prevent you from getting SARS2 or spreading it until last month. Before last month, you were selfish and potentially killing grandma if you decided not to get vaccinated.

Even now you can temporarily reduce risk to others with a booster.
