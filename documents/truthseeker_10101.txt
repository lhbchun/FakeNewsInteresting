@WastedAerospace @Lando73768101 @EmergencyHolog2 @MaryOk63537627 @GaineyJohnny @billmaher Remember that the CDC is counting Covid deaths even if the person died from other causes. 

Italy walked back more than 50% of their numbers because of mis-counts.

Motorcycle accident victim in FL gets counted as a COVID death. 

Why do they have to inflate the numbers?
