@Lazzy102 @SocialKeenan @OttawaPolice @OIPRD_BDIEP @ctvottawa @CBCOttawa @OttawaCitizen That's the same as with the vaccine.  But all available evidence so far shows that natural immunity beats vaccinated immunity.  So how come my immunity - which is stronger than vaccinated immunity - is not recognized?  I am less likely to spread Covid than a vaccinated person.
