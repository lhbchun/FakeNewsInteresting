@baIdbitxh @LorianaPatterso @SharikaSoal84 No one is saying people arent dying. However, its an extremely small percentage of people dying. Plus the CDC guidelines for reporting Covid related deaths are a joke and grossly inflate the numbers. A sad fact of life is people die. Hiding in our homes cant stop that.
