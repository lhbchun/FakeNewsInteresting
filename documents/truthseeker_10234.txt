@beaglesays @DrStephenT @JohnwBannon @sophieelsworth 60K on average die each year in the US from seasonal flu. 80K died in the 2017-18 season.

Despite CDC's best efforts to inflate the numbers (and idiots like Cuomo intentionally infecting vulnerable populations), we don't have that many actual deaths from COVID.
