@elisaperego78 @CovidSolidarit1 @LongCovidItalia Imagine  Wow, that long,  eh? 

Cause in Canada (as of a few weeks ago) Covid only lasts 10 days. 
(Positive test - 10 days later = back to work
Also, not dead after 10 days= reported as recovered). 

Logical conclusion = let's hope not to get the common cold
