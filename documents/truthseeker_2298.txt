@kevlarcomedy @eric99_kelly @SethMacFarlane Gosh, Kevin - are you aware vaccinated people DO often get infected &amp; transmit the virus to others?  It's called "breakthrough" infection.  Caused by grossly negligent individuals who refuse to mask - vaxxed or not.

If you're rational and believe science, you'll blame THEM.
