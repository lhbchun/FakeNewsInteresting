@NPrulz @denise_dewald Ok please give me the link to the previously studied and fully FDA approved human mRNA vaccine, I missed all the research and testing on it in the last 20 years of my career. I'm clumsy sometimes.

Researching an idea for 2-3 decades does not mean it's not a new vax technology.
