@NebGradDubDub @KennyJo36110417 @LarsAnderson71 This isn't a vaccine (until recently when the definition of vaccine was changed by google, etc..) it is a new protein Mrna gene therapy shot. I never got the flu shot and was fine when I did get the flu. 98.7% of people who died from covid were all sick and obese anyway.
