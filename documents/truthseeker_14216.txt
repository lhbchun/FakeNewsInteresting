@timspector @EricTopol @drraghibali Rates doubling is just positive test results, is that right?  Not because actual illness. So, when the surge testing and the fear-mongering happens test, and therefore, cases go up. What about deaths - how are those going?  Pretty good I hear (via non MSM channels, of course)
