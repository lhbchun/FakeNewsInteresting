@widowblack2220 @Peter_Fitz You do know that there isn't a miracle cure for COVID-19?? Hence why a vaccine is great; you're unlikely to die, end up in ICU or be in hospital if you're vaxed. Your symptoms are probably going to be mild or asymptomatic. Also COVID-19 vaccines reduce transmission to others
