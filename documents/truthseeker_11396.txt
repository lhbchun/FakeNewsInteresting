@fizzy_sunshine @Prophilaxias @drphiliplee1 Natural immunity is far stronger &amp; more consistent than the Covid Vaccine which starts wearing off from the moment it is injected, &amp; by 8-10weeks is non-existent. It may or may not protect you from death should you catch Covid. No-one else. You can still be contagious to others!
