@audracmorris @jrzygirlinfla @mehdirhasan @kprather88 You have more of a chance for heart problems with covid, not the vaccine. Natural immunity  wanes faster than the vaccines do. One third of people who get covid produce no antibodies. You got a mild case next time around you might not be so lucky.
