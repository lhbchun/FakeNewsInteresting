@OzCuriouser @Davecra23415973 @NSWHealth I agree. The NSW government have been slow to react to outbreaks. If the Northern Beaches outbreak would have happened during the winter, it would've been much worse. I feel the go hard &amp; early approach will be the go too one in Australia before the vaccine is here.
