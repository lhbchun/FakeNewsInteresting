@oilinki @goo_stewart @Zerogra83825752 @Ajarncom SARS had lower transmissibility, no evidence of asymptomatic transmission, but a much higher clinical severity (which incorporates death rate). Relatively easy to contain and stop- which was done and prevented it from becoming endemic. Not so with Covid-19.
