@ChloeSalsameda @OANN @nytimes If I got ran over and killed by an automobile, they'd associate it with a COVID-19 death. The numbers are trash. People keep preaching "the data". The data is BS. Government, CDC, WHO and others inflate "the data". If bureaucrats are associated with "the data", it's BS!!
