@Truthse26589591 @PoliticsForAlI I think you're right. Changing tactics to being laid back then cases will soar in winter, the vaccines won't work as claimed, a new variant will be blamed for the "escape" infections, more panic, the unvaccinated will be blamed even more, "kids must all be vaccinated" etc etc...
