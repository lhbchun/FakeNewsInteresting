@BamaCrazy1 @JuliaLBach8 @TracyBethHoeg Texas basically stopped testing a long time ago. Their average tests per day are significantly less than many states like MA that have about 25% of the population of TX. Much higher percent positive. And any natural immunity was at the cost of 50,000 deaths (underreported).
