@EricHar16025556 @nanelvisfan @ChrisSchmittCle @Delta I'm aware that a huge group of people in the U.S. have decided that masks are political. But I work in public health. I'm fully vaccinated &amp; I still wear a mask when I'm in public. That's because I believe in science, I understand data &amp; I care about not making other people sick.
