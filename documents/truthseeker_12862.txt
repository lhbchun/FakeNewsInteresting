@headiemi @VADepSec @DeptVetAffairs So why is Veteran homelessness rising? What's the risk factor for Military aged adults who are healthy getting severely sick from Coronavirus? I bet it's way less than the number of homeless Veterans every night in the US.  Do more Veterans die everyday from suicide or CV?
