@thereal_truther @stacey_rudin @CustmHealthspan @DrTomFrieden More people died of suicide in Japan in one month than the entire coronavirus pandemic....wow smart to lockdown because of the virus.  There are more ways then lockdowns to decrease mortality and morbidity from the virus!  Too much political BS in the lockdown
