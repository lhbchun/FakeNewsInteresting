@JoeClitherow @cirian75 @Channel4News My point is that when you suggest getting herd immunity without vaccine you can only get it by allowing its spread. For measles, with an Ro of 16, you need 95% vaccination. The Ro for Covid is lower but without vax you need 60 to 80% infection. Millions would die. It's murder.
