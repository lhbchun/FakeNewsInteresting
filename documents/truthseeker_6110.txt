@PrisonPlanet @ClimateRealists The professor gets it wrong.

The problem is the vaccinated, not the unvaccinated (who will be fine if healthy).

Omicron is an immune escape variant. It escapes the vaccine but not natural immunity.

Thats why boosters with current vaccines are useless, but O can vax the vaxed.
